BURNING.  Massive flames.  A dark shape emerges- The BAT
SYMBOL.  Growing.  Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.
CUT TO:: DAYLIGHT.  Moving over the towers of downtown Gotham...
Closing in on an office building... On a large window...
Which SHATTERS to reveal-

INT. OFFICE, HIGH RISE -- DAY

A man in a CLOWN MASK holding a SMOKING SILENCED PISTOL
ejects a shell casing.  This is DOPEY.  He turns to a second
man, HAPPY, also in clown mask, who steps forward with a
CABLE LAUNCHER, aims at a lower roof across the street and
FIRES a cable across.  Dopey secures the line to an I-beam
line- CLAMP on- sends a KIT BAG out then steps OUT the
window...

EXT. HIGH-RISE -- DAY

...into space.  The men SLIDE across the DIZZYING DROP...
landing on the lower roof across the street.

EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- DAY

A MAN on the corner, back to us, holding a CLOWN MASK.  An
SUV pulls up.  The man gets in, puts on his mask.  Inside the
car- two other men wearing CLOWN MASKS.
GRUMPY: Three of a kind.  Let's do this.
One of the Clowns looks up from loading his automatic weapon.
CHUCKLES: That's it?  Three guys?
GRUMPY: There's two on the roof.  Every guy
is an extra share.  Five shares is
plenty.
CHUCKLES: Six shares.  Don't forget the guy who
planned the job.
GRUMPY: Yeah?  He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice then I get why
they call him the Joker.
Grumpy cocks his weapon.  Bozo pulls the car over in front of
the GOTHAM FIRST NATIONAL BANK.

EXT. ROOFTOP, BANK -- CONTINUOUS

Dopey PRIES open an access panel-
HAPPY: Why do they call him the Joker?
DOPEY: I heard he wears make-up.
HAPPY: Make-up?
Dopey pulls out thick bundles of blue CAT 5 cables.
DOPEY: Yeah.  To scare people.  War paint.

EXT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS

Grumpy, Chuckles and Bozo get out of the car and march into
the bank CARRYING ASSAULT RIFLES-

INT. BANK -- DAY

The Security Guard looks up- Grumpy FIRES into the ceiling.
Customers SCREAM.  Chuckles CRACKS the Security Guard.
As Grumpy and Bozo round up the hostages, one of the TELLERS
presses a button mounted beneath her window- a SILENT ALARM.

EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY

Dopey watches the alarm PING his handheld.
DOPEY: Here comes the silent alarm.
(touches a button)
And there it goes.  That's funny.  It
didn't dial out to 911-  it was
trying to reach a private number.
Behind him, Happy RAISES his silenced HANDGUN.
HAPPY: Is it a problem?
DOPEY: No, no.  I'm done here.
Happy SHOOTS.  Dopey SLUMPS.  Happy picks up his bag and
FORCES OPEN the roof access door...

INT. STAIRWELL, BANK -- DAY

...and speeds down the stairs, to the basement.  He SLAMS
open the door...
2.

INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY

...and comes face to face with a huge VAULT.

INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY

Bozo and Grumpy move down the line of hostages- Bozo hands
each Hostage OBJECTS from a bag.  A GRENADE.  Grumpy follows,
PULLING THE PINS.:
GRUMPY: Obviously, we don't want you doing
anything with your hands other than
holding on for dear life.
BLAM.: Chuckles is BLOWN OFF HIS FEET- Grumpy and Bozo DIVE
for cover- the Bank Manager steps out of his office, SHOTGUN
in hand.  Hostages SCRAMBLE, CLINGING their grenades...

INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY

Happy CLAMPS a DRILL to the vault- the bit SPINS- SLIDES into
the metal door- a BOLT of ELECTRICITY RIPS THROUGH THE DRILL,
THROWING HAPPY TO THE FLOOR-

INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY

Grumpy and Bozo cower as the Bank Manager FIRES again.
GRUMPY: He's got three left?
Bozo raises TWO fingers.  Grumpy squeezes off a SHOT.  The
Bank Manager FIRES.  FIRES again.  Grumpy looks at Bozo, who
nods.  Grumpy JUMPS UP.
The Bank Manager FIRES- Grumpy GRUNTS as buckshot CLIPS his
shoulder.  FALLS.  The Bank Manager moves in for the kill,
FUMBLING for new shells.  Bozo STANDS- SHOOTS him.
Bozo picks up the shotgun.  Grumpy checks his wound- it's
superficial.  He struggles to his feet.
GRUMPY: Where'd you learn to count?!
Bozo's mask stares him down.  Grumpy heads for the stairs in
the back.  Bozo starts loading fresh shells into the shotgun.
BANK MANAGER: You have any idea who you're stealing
from?  You and your friends are dead.
Bozo looks down at him.  Says nothing.
3.

INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY

Happy at the vault door, barefoot, turning the tumblers with
hands stuffed into his SNEAKERS.  Grumpy walks in.
HAPPY: They wired this thing up with 5,000
volts.  What kind of bank does that?
GRUMPY: A mob bank.  Guess the Joker's as
crazy as they say.
Happy shrugs.  Grips the WHEEL BOLT and SPINS it.
GRUMPY: Where's the alarm guy?
HAPPY: Boss told me when the guy was done I
should take him out.  One less share.
GRUMPY: Funny, he told me something
similar...
Happy FREEZES.  The wheel SPINS to a STOP- the vault DOOR
CLUNKS OPEN- Happy GRABS for his weapon- SPINS to see Grumpy
SHOOT.  Grumpy steps over Happy into the vault...

INT. VAULT, BANK -- DAY

...which is filled with an eight-foot MOUNTAIN OF CASH.

INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY

Grumpy walks into the lobby, straining under several DUFFELS
filled with cash.  He DUMPS them.  Looks at Bozo.  LAUGHS.
GRUMPY: C'mon, there's a lot to carry...

INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY

Bozo walks back into the lobby with two more DUFFELS.  Sets
them down on an ENORMOUS PILE.  Grumpy looks at it.
GRUMPY: If this guy was so smart he would
have had us bring a bigger car.
Grumpy JABS his pistol in Bozo's back.  Takes his weapon.
GRUMPY: I'm betting the Joker told you to
kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
4.
BOZO: (shakes head)
No.  I kill the bus driver.
GRUMPY: Bus driver?  What bus-
Bozo steps backwards.  SMASH.  Hostages SCREAM as the TAIL
END OF A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS ROCKETS through the front of the
bank, SLAMMING Grumpy into the teller's window.
Bozo picks up Grumpy's weapon.  Another clown OPENS the rear
door of the bus.  Bozo SHOOTS him.  Then loads the bags onto
the bus.  The wounded Bank Manager watches him.  In the
distance: SIRENS.
BANK MANAGER: Think you're smart, huh?  Well, the
guy who hired you's just do the same
to you...
Bozo slowly shakes his head.
BANK MANAGER: Sure he will.  Criminals in this town
used to believe in things...
Bozo turns back to the Bank Manager.  Crouches over him.
BANK MANAGER: Honor.  Respect.  What do you
believe, huh?  What do you bel-
Joker slides a GRENADE into the man's mouth.  A PURPLE THREAD
is knotted around the pin.
THE JOKER: I believe that what doesn't kill
you...
Bozo PULLS off his MASK.  The Bank Manager GASPS.  In the
reflections of the glass DEBRIS behind the Bank Manager we
see GLIMPSES of a SCARRED MOUTH and CLOWN MAKEUP.  THE JOKER.
THE JOKER: ...simply makes you stranger.
The Bank Manager's eyes go wide.  The Joker rises, strolls
towards the bus, the purple thread attached to the grenade
pin UNRAVELLING FROM THE PURPLE LINING of his jacket as he
walks.  The Joker climbs into the bus, SHUTS the rear door,
TRAPPING THE PURPLE THREAD...

EXT. SCHOOL, GOTHAM -- DAY

Kids pour out, heading onto a long line of school buses.
5.

INT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS

As the bus pulls out, the purple thread PULLS THE PIN-
hostages scream and scurry away from the Bank Manager, who
shakes with fear as, with a FIZZ, the grenade does not
explode, but SPEWS RED SMOKE.

EXT. BANK -- DAY

The School Bus pulls free of the Bank wall and pulls out onto
the street, SLIDING INTO THE LINE OF IDENTICAL BUSES HEADING
PAST THE BANK.  The buses trundle past COP CARS racing up the
street... and we-
CUT TO::

EXT. MOVING OVER GOTHAM -- NIGHT

From the top of a brick building a SHAFT OF LIGHT comes on.

EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- CONTINUOUS

A PATROLMAN looks up at the BAT-SIGNAL.  Smiles.  A DEALER
standing beside a car spots the signal.  Steps back.
DEALER: No, man.  I don't like it tonight.
BUYER: What're you, superstitious?  You got
more chance of winning the powerball
than running into him...

INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

DETECTIVE RAMIREZ, female, rookie detective, 30's, makes
coffee, watching a news show on the television.
ON SCREEN: The host, MIKE ENGEL, lays into the MAYOR.
ENGEL: Mr Mayor, you were elected on a
campaign to clean up the city... when
are you going to start?
MAYOR: Well, Mike-
ENGEL: Like this so-called Batman- a lot of
people say he's doing some good
that criminals are running scared...
but I say NO.  What kind of hero
needs to wear a mask?  You don't let
vigilantes run around breaking the
law... where does it end?
6.
(MORE): Yet, we hear rumors that instead of
trying to arrest him the cops are
using him to do their dirty work.
MAYOR: I'm told our men in the Major Crimes
Unit are close to an arrest.
RAMIREZ: Hey, Wuertz- the Mayor says you're
closing in on the Batman.
WUERTZ looks up, listless.  Crumples up a paper.
WUERTZ: The investigation is ongoing.
He throws the paper at the trash.  It rebounds off a board
headed 'BATMAN: SUSPECTS.'  Lined with pictures: Abraham
Lincoln.  Elvis.  The Abominable Snowman.

EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT -- NIGHT

Ramirez comes out onto the roof.  LIEUTENANT GORDON sits by a
SEARCHLIGHT.  She hands Gordon a cup of coffee.
RAMIREZ: Ever intending to see your wife
again, Lieutenant?
GORDON: I thought you had to go look after
your mother, detective.
RAMIREZ: They checked her back into hospital.
GORDON: I'm sorry.
RAMIREZ: (making light)
Least there she's got someone round
the clock.  Unlike your wife.
(looks at bat-signal)
He hasn't shown?
Gordon gets up.  Looks into the sky at the bat-signal.
GORDON: Often doesn't.  But I like reminding
everybody that he's out there.
RAMIREZ: Why wouldn't he come?
GORDON: Hopefully...  Because he's busy.
7.
ENGEL (cont'd)

EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- NIGHT

Two black SUV's pull onto the top floor.  A large man emerges-
the CHECHEN.
A BODYGUARD points at the sky.  The Chechen
peers up at the BAT-SIGNAL.  Shrugs.
CHECHEN: That's why we bring dogs.
BODYGUARD 2 opens the back door- three enormous ROTWEILERS
emerge, GROWLING.  The Chechen crouches, KISSING the dogs.
CHECHEN: My little princes...
(to bodyguards)
The Batman's invisible to you
fools... but my little princes...
they can find human meat in complete
darkness.
The Chechen moves to the second SUV, reaches in and DRAGS out
a skinny, wild-eyed JUNKIE by his hair.
JUNKIE: (babbling)
No!  No get 'em off me!  Off me!
The Chechen drags the Junkie towards a battered white van.
The van's REAR DOORS OPEN... two armed THUGS emerge, carrying
BARRELS...  a third hovers in the dark interior.
CHECHEN: Look!  Look what your drugs did to my
customers!
VOICE (O.S.): Buyer beware...
The figure emerges: SCARECROW.  Wearing his mask.
SCARECROW: I told your man my compound would
take you places.  I never said they'd
be places you wanted to go.
CHECHEN: My business is repeat customers.
SCARECROW: If you don't like what I have to
offer, buy from someone else.
Assuming Batman left anyone else to
buy from.
The Chechen frowns.  THE DOGS START BARKING.
8.
BODYGUARD: (nervous)
He's here.
A BURLY THUG at the periphery is suddenly SUCKED into the
darkness.  In his place a shadow straightens, revealing
POINTED BAT-EARS against the glittering skyline.
CHECHEN: Come on, sonofbitch- my dogs are
hungry, pity there's only one of
you...
A BODYGUARD to the side DISAPPEARS with a scream, and a
SECOND BAT-SHADOW appears.
The Chechen looks taken aback.  Three more BAT-SHADOWS
appear... even the dogs stop growling.
BOOM!  A hole appears in the SUV next to the Chechen.
The
first bat-shadow steps into the light carrying a SHOTGUN.
CHAOS as men scatter and the rooftop erupts in GUNFIRE.  The
Chechen TURNS as he hears one of his men SCREAM.
CHECHEN (CONT’D): Loose the dogs!
A Bodyguard releases the DOGS- they RACE, SALIVATING, into
the darkness...
The Dogs RACE towards a Bat-Shadow- the first dog LEAPS, gets
its JAWS around the Bat-Shadow's throat...
Scarecrow ducks behind the van- holes PUNCHED in the side by
shotgun blasts right behind him.  He starts to climb into the
driver's seat-
The muzzle of a shotgun is pressed to the back of his head- a
bat-shadow is behind him- he SPRAYS him with FEAR TOXIN- the
bat-shadow collapses to the ground, SCREAMING.  The Cechnyan,
cowering from gunfire, looks down at him.
SCARECROW: Not the real thing.
CHECHEN: How you know?
SCARECROW: We're old friends.
A HUGE BLACK SHAPE SLAMS down onto a row of parked cars.  The
BATMOBILE.:
SCARECROW: That's more like it.
9.
The Chechen's men BLAST away at the front of the car: the
bullets SPARK off its monstrous surface harmlessly...

INT. BATMOBILE -- CONTINUOUS

The cockpit is EMPTY.  One of the screens reads "LOITER".
The shooting STOPS.  The screen switches to "INTIMIDATE"

EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS

The men STARE at the Batmobile for a quiet moment... BOOM!
The Batmobile CANNONS blast cars all around the men-
A bat-shadow lines up his shotgun on a running bodyguard-
CLUNK- a BLACK GAUNTLET grasps the barrel and BENDS it
upwards with a HOWL of tortured steel- the bat-shadow looks
into the face of the Batman.  The REAL BATMAN.
The Bat-shadow STUMBLES BACKWARDS in terror, leaving the bent
shotgun in Batman's hand.  Batman OPENS his hand, revealing a
PNEUMATIC MANGLE hidden in his palm-
Batman bears down on the dogs mauling another bat-shadow-
DRAWS his GRAPPLING GUN and SHOOTS his grapple into the fake
Batman's leg and RIPS him from the dogs, one dog HANGING ON
as Batman pulls the unconscious man away...  the Chechen RUNS
down the ramp towards the exit...
As Batman KICKS the dog off the fake Batman- the Chechen gets
into his SUV- another dog LOCKS ITS JAWS around Batman's
forearm, RIPPING, TEARING- Batman SWINGS THE DOG OVER HIS
HEAD- SMASHES it against the ground- its jaws OPEN...
Batman rises, an engine RACES behind him- he can't turn in
time- BLAM- he's SLAMMED sideways by the speeding van.

INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Scarecrow, driving, NODS at him and hits the gas... Batman
raises his hand, revealing his jointed mangle and pistons.
The mangle STRAIGHTENS and ROTATES from his palm to the knife
edge of his opened hand...
Batman CHOPS straight through the windshield- pulls his hand
out and CHOPS again- the mangle gets STUCK- Scarecrow steers
towards a column...

EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Batman can't free himself- he turns a dial on his forearm
piston- EXPLOSIVE BOLTS blow, freeing his gauntlet from the
mangle- he ROLLS free of the van as it SCRAPES the column and
barrels down the circular exit ramp.
Batman rises.  A phony batman lying on the ground watches as
Batman climbs up to the edge of the ten-story corkscrew ramp
and stands there, waiting for something.
10.
After a moment he JUMPS... and falls... ten stories...
He's about to hit the exit ramp- the van appears- his cape
POPS OPEN- he SLAMS into the roof, CRUSHING the cab.

EXT. ROOFTOP, PARKING GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

The Chechen's men are lined up against the wall, bound with
zip-ties.  So are the fake batmen.  Batman DUMPS Scarecrow
next to the three "Batmen", RIPS his mask off.
"BATMAN": We're trying to help you!
BATMAN: I don't need help.
SCARECROW: Not my diagnosis.
Batman silences Scarecrow with his boot.  Turns to "Batman"
BATMAN: Don't let me find you out here again.
Batman moves towards the Batmobile.
"BATMAN": You need us!  There's only one of you-
it's war out here!
Batman gets into the Batmobile.
"BATMAN": What gives you the right?!  What's
the difference between you and me?!
As the Canopy hisses shut-
BATMAN: I'm not wearing hockey pads.
The "Batman" looks down at his makeshift costume as the
Batmobile ROARS past.

EXT. BANK -- NIGHT

LIEUTENANT GORDON ducks the barrage of SHOUTED QUESTIONS from
press and picks his way into the lobby of the bank.

INT. LOBBY, BANK -- NIGHT

FORENSIC SPECIALISTS work the room.  Ramirez hands Gordon
PRINTS- indicates the surveillance cameras.
RAMIREZ: He can't resist showing us his face.
11.
Gordon looks at the grainy blow-up of THE JOKER'S FACE: sweating clown makeup plastered thick around the mouth.
GORDON: Put this out, by morning we can put a
big top over central holding and
sell tickets.  What's he hiding under
that makeup?
Gordon approaches a FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHER shooting Grumpy's
body.  Gordon crouches to look at his clown mask.  Batman
steps from the shadows.  Gordon nods at Ramirez.
RAMIREZ: Give us a minute, please, people!
The Forensic team and Ramirez leave.  Gordon hands Batman the
blow-up of the Joker.
BATMAN: Him again.  Who are the others?
GORDON: Another bunch of small timers.
Batman pulls a DEVICE from his belt- moves to the bundles of
cash scattered near the clown's body.  The device PINGS.
Batman picks up a BUNDLE.  Hands it to Gordon.
BATMAN: Some of the marked bills I gave you.
GORDON: My detectives have been making drug
buys with them for weeks.  This bank
was another drop for the mob.  That
makes five banks- we've found the
bulk of their dirty cash.
BATMAN: Time to move in.
Gordon waves the photo.
GORDON: What about this Joker guy?
BATMAN: One man or the entire mob?  He can
wait.
GORDON: We'll have to hit all banks
simultaneously.  SWAT teams, backup.
Gordon holds up the bundle of banknotes.
12.
GORDON: When the new DA gets wind of this,
he'll want in.
BATMAN: Do you trust him?
GORDON: Be hard to keep him out.
Gordon bags the cash.
GORDON: I hear he's as stubborn as you.
But Batman is already gone.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- MORNING

Alfred walks past soaring downtown views as he carries a
breakfast tray through the vast, empty penthouse.  He stops,
looking at a still-made bed.  Alfred sighs, turns.

EXT. RAIL YARDS -- MORNING

Alfred gets out of the Rolls carrying a thermos.  He walks
towards a RAILWAY BRIDGE, stops at a FREIGHT CONTAINER
sitting, lopsided, on blocks.  Alfred unlocks the RUSTY
PADLOCK AND CHAIN.  Steps inside.

INT. FREIGHT CONTAINER -- CONTINUOUS

Alfred FUMBLES in the dark- bangs his elbow- A HISS as the
FLOOR LOWERS... Alfred sinks down into...

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- CONTINUOUS

The container floor lowers on a giant PISTON.  Alfred steps
off into a large, LOW-CEILINGED CONCRETE CHAMBER.  The
Batmobile sits in the middle.  Machines- 3d printers, power
tools- dot the high-tech space.  At one end, Wayne sits at a
bank of monitors watching CCTV footage of the bank robbery.
ALFRED: Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt
and you can swap not sleeping in a
penthouse for not sleeping in a
mansion.
Alfred places a cup of coffee in front of Wayne, who is
STITCHING up a cut on his arm.
ALFRED (CONT’D): (takes needle)
When you stitch yourself up you make
a bloody mess.
13.
WAYNE: But I learn from my mistakes.
ALFRED: You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.
WAYNE: My armor... I'm carrying too much
weight- I need to be faster.
ALFRED: I'm sure Mr.Fox can oblige.
(looks at wound)
Did you get mauled by a tiger?
WAYNE: A dog.
(off look)
A big dog.  There were more copycats
last night, Alfred.  With guns.
ALFRED: Perhaps you could hire some of them
and take weekends off.
WAYNE: This wasn't exactly what I had in
mind when I said I wanted to inspire
people.
ALFRED: I know.  But things are improving.
Look at the new District Attorney...
Wayne indicates a monitor: a handsome MAN in a suit.
WAYNE: I am.  Closely.  I need to know if he
can be trusted.
Alfred looks at other images- the D.A. at a meeting.
Campaigning.  Helping someone out of a cab: RACHEL.
ALFRED: Are you interested in his
character... or his social circle?
WAYNE: Who Rachel spends her time with is
her business.
ALFRED: Well, I trust you're not following me
on my day off.
WAYNE: If you ever took one, I might.
14.
Alfred bites the thread.  Examines his stitches.  Looks at
the SCARS criss-crossing Wayne's shoulders.
ALFRED: Know your limits, Master Wayne.
WAYNE: Batman has no limits.
ALFRED: Well, you do, sir.
WAYNE: I can't afford to know them.
ALFRED: And what happens the day you find
out?
WAYNE: We all know how much you like to say
'I told you so'.
ALFRED: That day, Master Wayne, even I won't
want to.  Probably.

INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY

HARVEY DENT bursts into the courtroom.  Assistant D.A. RACHEL
DAWES, look up, ANNOYED.
DENT: Sorry I'm late, folks.
Rachel leans in to Dent, speaking under her breath.
RACHEL: Where were you?
DENT: Worried you'd have to step up?
RACHEL: I know the briefs backwards.
Dent pulls a large silver dollar out of his pocket.  Grins.
DENT: Well, then, fair's fair: heads, I'll
take it.  Tails, he's all yours.
Dent FLIPS.  Shows it to Rachel- heads.
RACHEL: You're flipping coins to see who
leads?
15.
DENT: My father's lucky coin.  As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.
RACHEL: I'm serious, Harvey, you don't leave
things like this to chance.
DENT: I don't.
(sincere)
I make my own luck.
Dent looks across at the defendant- SAL MARONI.
MARONI: I thought the DA just played golf
with the Mayor, things like that.
DENT: Tee-off's 1:30.  More than enough
time to put you away for life, Sally.
The BAILIFFS lead a THIN MAN into the witness box.  ROSSI.

INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY

Rossi takes a SIP of water.  Dent works the room.
DENT: With Carmine Falcone in Arkham,
someone must've stepped up to run the
so-called family.
(Rossi nods)
Is this man in the courtroom today?
(Rossi nods again)
Could you identify him for us,
please?
Dent turns to Maroni, who is poker-faced.  Dent smiles.
ROSSI: You win, counselor.  It was me.
Dent's smile disappears.  He turns back to Rossi.
DENT: I've got a sworn statement from you
that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is
the new head of the Falcone crime
family.
ROSSI: Maroni?  He's a fall guy.  I'm the
brains of the organization.
LAUGHS from the gallery.  Dent turns to the JUDGE.
16.
DENT: Permission to treat the witness as
hostile?
ROSSI: Hostile?  I'll show you hostile.
Rossi JUMPS UP, points a GUN at Dent's face.  SCREAMS from
the gallery.  Rossi PULLS the TRIGGER- the gun MISFIRES with
a POP.  Dent steps forward, grabs the GUN- DECKS Rossi with a
RIGHT CROSS- unloads the GUN and sets it down in front of
Maroni.
DENT: Ceramic 28 caliber.  Made in China.
If you want to kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy
American.
Everyone STARES, open-mouthed, as Dent adjusts his tie.  The
Bailiffs are wrestling Rossi from the box-
DENT (CONT’D): But, your honor, I'm not done...

INT. LOBBY, DENT'S OFFICE, DA'S -- DAY

Rachel, excited, leads Dent through the lobby.
RACHEL: We'll never link the gun to Maroni,
so we can't charge him, but I'll tell
you one thing- the fact they tried to
kill you means we're getting to them.
DENT: Glad you're so pleased, Rachel.  I'm
fine by the way.
Rachel turns to Dent.  Smooths his lapels.
RACHEL: Harvey, you're Gotham's D.A.- if
you're not getting shot at, you're
not doing your job.
(smiles)
'Course if you said you were rattled
we could take the rest of the day...
DENT: Can't.  I dragged the head of the
Major Crimes Unit down here.
RACHEL: Jim Gordon?  He's a friend- try to be
nice.
17.

INT. DENT'S OFFICE -- DAY

Gordon stands as Dent enters.  The two men shake.
GORDON: Word is you've got a hell of a right
cross.  Shame Sal's going to walk.
DENT: Well, good thing about the mob is
they keep giving you second chances.
Dent picks up a bundle of bills from the heist.
DENT: Lightly irradiated bills.  Fancy
stuff for a city cop.  Have help?
GORDON: We liaise with various agencies-
DENT: Save it, Gordon.  I want to meet him.
GORDON: Official policy is to arrest the
vigilante known as Batman on sight.
DENT: And that flood light on top of
M.C.U.?:
GORDON: If you have any concerns about...
malfunctioning equipment... take them
up with maintenance, counselor.
Dent tosses the bills back onto his desk.  Annoyed.
DENT: I've put every known money launderer
in Gotham behind bars.  But the mob
is still getting its money out.  I
think you and your "friend" have
found the last game in town and
you're trying to hit 'em where it
hurts: their wallets.  Bold.  You
gonna count me in?
GORDON: In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.
DENT: Gordon, I don't like that you've got
your own special unit, and I don't
like that it's full of cops I
investigated at internal affairs.
18.
GORDON: If I didn't work with cops you'd
investigated while you were making
your name at I.A.- I'd be working
alone.  I don't get political points
for being an idealist- I have to do
the best I can with what I have.
Dent looks at Gordon.  Considering how to proceed.
DENT: You want me to back warrants for
search and seizure on five banks
without telling me who we're after?
GORDON: I can give you the names of the
banks.
DENT: Well, that's a start.  I'll get you
your warrants.  But I want your
trust.
GORDON: (rises)
You don't have to sell me, Dent.  We
all know you're Gotham's white
knight.
DENT: (grins)
I hear they've got a different
nickname for me down at M.C.U..
Gordon smiles.

INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY

LUCIUS FOX, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, and the board listen to
LAU, 40s, CEO of L.S.I. Holdings.
LAU: In China L.S.I. Holdings stands for
dynamic new growth.  A joint Chinese
venture with Wayne Enterprises will
be a powerhouse.
FOX: Well, Mr.Lau, I speak for the rest of
the board, and Mr.Wayne, in
expressing our own excitement...
The Chinese look to the head of the table: Wayne, ASLEEP.
19.

INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY

Fox shows Lau to the elevator.  He's joined by, REESE, 30s,
an ambitious M and A consultant lawyer.
LAU: It's OK, Mr.Fox.
Everyone knows who
really runs Wayne Enterprises.
FOX: We'll be in touch as soon as our
people have wrapped up the diligence.
The elevator doors close.  Reese frowns.
REESE: Sir, I know Mr.Wayne's curious how
his trust fund gets replenished but
frankly... it's embarrassing.
Fox heads for his office, Reese in tow.
FOX: You worry about the diligence, Mr.
Reese.  I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
REESE: It's done- the numbers are solid.
FOX: (smiles)
Do it again.  Wouldn't want the trust
fund to run out, would we?

INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne is standing by the window.
FOX: Another long night?
(Wayne smiles)
This joint venture was your idea, and
the consultants love it, but I'm not
convinced.  L.S.I.'s grown 8 percent
annually, like clockwork.  They must
have a revenue stream that's off the
books.  Maybe even illegal.
WAYNE: OK.  Cancel the deal.
FOX: (looks at Wayne)
You already knew.
WAYNE: I needed a closer look at their
books.
20.
Fox looks at Wayne.  Wry.
FOX: Anything else you can trouble me for?
WAYNE: I need a new suit.
FOX: (looks him over)
Three buttons is a little nineties.
WAYNE: I'm not talking about fashion,
Mr.Fox, so much as function.
Wayne pulls some diagrams.  Fox looks them over.
FOX: You want to be able to turn your
head?
WAYNE: Sure make backing out of the driveway
easier.
FOX: I'll see what I can do.

INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

Rachel and Dent at a table.  Dent looks a little intimidated
by the surroundings.
DENT: It took three weeks to get a
reservation and I had to tell them I
worked for the government.
RACHEL: Really?
DENT: This city health inspector's not
afraid to pull strings.
Rachel smiles.  Then, over Dent's shoulder, she sees Wayne
enter, accompanied by a beautiful woman.
DENT: What?
WAYNE: Rachel!  Fancy that.
RACHEL: Yes, Bruce.  Fancy that.
21.
WAYNE: Rachel, Natascha.  Natascha, Rachel.
NATASCHA: (Russian accent)
Hello.
DENT: The famous Bruce Wayne.  Rachel's
told me everything about you.
WAYNE: I certainly hope not.
RACHEL: Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.
WAYNE: Let's put a couple tables together.
DENT: I don't know if they'll let us-
WAYNE: They should!  I own the place.
RACHEL: For how long?  About three weeks?
WAYNE: How'd you know?
RACHEL: Natascha, aren't you...?
WAYNE: Prima ballerina for the Moscow
Ballet.
RACHEL: Harvey's taking me next week.
WAYNE: You're into ballet, Harvey?
RACHEL: No.  He knows I am.
An extra table arrives.

INT. SAME -- LATER

They finish up dinner.
NATASCHA: No, come on- how could you want to
raise children in a city like this?
22.
WAYNE: I was raised here.  I turned out OK.
DENT: Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?
Rachel gives Dent a withering look.
WAYNE: The Palisades?  Sure.  You know, as
our new D.A. you might want to figure
out where your jurisdiction ends.
NATASCHA: I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante...
DENT: Gotham's proud of an ordinary man
standing up for what's right.
NATASCHA: Gotham needs heroes like you- elected
officials, not a man who thinks he's
above the law.
WAYNE: Exactly.  Who appointed the Batman?
DENT: We did.  All of us who stood by and
let scum take control of our city.
Wayne watches Dent.  Sees his passion.
NATASCHA: But this is a democracy, Harvey.
DENT: When their enemies were at the gate,
the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the
city.  It wasn't considered an honor.
It was considered public service.
RACHEL: And the last man they asked to
protect the republic was named
Caesar.  He never gave up that power.
DENT: Well, I guess you either die a hero
or you live long enough to see
yourself become the villain.  Look,
whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
want to spend the rest of his life
doing this.  How could he?
23.
(MORE): ~Batman's looking for someone to take
up his mantle.
NATASCHA: Someone like you, Mr.Dent?
DENT: Maybe.  If I'm up to it.
Natascha reaches up and covers the top half of Dent's face.
NATASCHA: But what if Harvey Dent is the caped
crusader?
DENT: If I were sneaking out every night
someone would've noticed by now.
Dent takes Rachel's hand.  Rachel glances at Wayne.  Awkward.
WAYNE: Well, you've sold me, Dent.  I'm
gonna throw you a fundraiser.
DENT: That's nice of you, Bruce, but I'm
not up for reelection for three
years.  That stuff won't start for-
WAYNE: I don't think you understand.  One
fundraiser with my pals, you'll never
need another cent.

EXT. BACK ALLEY, HOTEL, DOWNTOWN -- DAY

A line of high-end AUTOS dispenses well dressed GANGSTERS.

INT. KITCHEN, HOTEL -- DAY

The Chechen walks through a METAL DETECTOR manned by two
CHINESE.  A lean, African-American man, 50's, is being
wanded.
This is GAMBOL.  He nods at the Chechen, wary.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

Gotham's most notorious GANGSTERS.  A door opens, and two
BURLY CHINESE enter, carrying a TV.  They set it down on the
end of the table.
CRIME BOSS: The hell is this...?
The screen flickers to life: Lau.
The room ERUPTS.
24.
DENT (cont'd)
LAU (ON T.V.): Gentlemen, please. As you're all
aware, one of our deposits was
stolen.  A relatively small amount: 68 million.
CHECHEN: Who's stupid enough steal from us?
LAU: I'm told the man who arranged the
heist calls himself Joker.
CHECHEN: Who the hell is that?
MARONI: Two-bit whack-job wears a cheap
purple suit and make-up.  He's not
the problem- he's a nobody.
(looks at Lau)
The problem is our money being
tracked by the cops.
Murmurs of surprise.
LAU: Thanks to Mr.Maroni's well-placed
sources we know that police have
indeed identified our banks using
marked bills and are planning to
seize your funds today-
Everyone starts SHOUTING at once.

EXT. VARIOUS DOWNTOWN BANKS -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon sits in a SWAT van outside a bank.  Stephens is
outside another.  Ramirez a third...
SWAT teams CHECK WEAPONS and prepare move...

INT. SOCIAL CLUB, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS

Lau waits for the noise to subside.
CHECHEN: You promised safe, clean money
launder-
LAU: With the investigation ongoing, none
of you can risk hanging on to your
own proceeds.  And since the
enthusiastic new D.A. has put all my
competitors out of business, I'm your
only option.
25.
MARONI: So what are you proposing?
LAU: Moving all deposits to one secure
location.  Not a bank.
GAMBOL: Where, then?
LAU: Obviously, no one can know but me.
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you everyone's money
would be at stake.
CHECHEN: What stops them getting to you?
LAU: As the money is moved I go to Hong
Kong.  Far from Dent's jurisdiction.
And the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.
From the back of the room comes LAUGHTER.  It grows and
grows, until it fills the room.  All eyes turn: The Joker.  Sweaty clown makeup obscuring the AWFUL SCARS
which widen his mouth into a PERMANENT, GHOULISH SMILE.
THE JOKER: I thought I told bad jokes.
GAMBOL: Give me one reason I shouldn't have
my boy here pull your head off.
The Joker pulls out a freshly sharpened pencil.
THE JOKER: How about a magic trick?
The Joker SLAMS the pencil into the table, leaving it
UPRIGHT.:
THE JOKER (CONT’D): I'll make this pencil disappear.
Gambol nods.  His BODYGUARD MOVES at the Joker- who SIDESTEPS-
GRIPS his head- SLAMS it, FACE DOWN, onto the table...
The Bodyguard goes LIMP and slides off of the table.  The
PENCIL is gone.  MAGIC.  The Joker BOWS.  Grins at Gambol.
26.
THE JOKER (CONT’D): And by the way, the suit wasn't
cheap.  You should know.  You bought
it.
Gambol STANDS, furious.  The Chechen stops him.
CHECHEN: Sit.  I wanna hear proposition.
The Joker nods his thanks.  Rises.
THE JOKER: A year ago these cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.  What
happened?  Did your balls drop off?
See, a guy like me-
GAMBOL: A freak.
Laughs.  Which the Joker tries to ignore.
THE JOKER: A guy like me... I know why you're
holding your little group therapy
session in broad daylight.  I know
why you're afraid to go out at night.
Batman.  He's shown Gotham your true
colors.  And Dent's just the
beginning.
(indicates Lau)
And as for his so-called plan- Batman
has no jurisdiction.  He'll find him
and make him squeal.
(smiles at Lau)
I can tell the squealers every time.
CHECHEN: What you propose?
THE JOKER: It's simple.  Kill the Batman.
Jeers.  Laughter.
MARONI: If it's so easy why haven't you done
it already?
THE JOKER: Like my mother used to tell me- if
you're good at something, never do it
for free.
CHECHEN: How much you want?
27.
THE JOKER: Half.
Laughter.  The Joker shrugs.  Rises.
THE JOKER (CONT’D): You don't deal with this now, soon
Gambol won't even be able to get a
nickel for his grandma-
GAMBOL: Enough from the clown.
Gambol gets up, MOVING at the Joker, who casually opens his
coat, revealing EXPLOSIVES wired to his chest.  Gambol stops.
THE JOKER: Let's not blow this out of all
proportion.
Gambol stares at the Joker.  Hard.
GAMBOL: You think you can steal from us and
just walk away?  I'm putting the word
out- 5 hundred grand for this clown
dead.  A million alive, so I get to
teach him some manners, first.
The Joker shrugs.  Turns to the assembled.
THE JOKER: Let me know when you change your
minds.
The Joker strolls out.  Maroni turns to Lau.
MARONI: How soon can you move the money?

EXT. VARIOUS BANKS DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon hurries up the steps to a bank.  SWAT teams rush the
various banks.
LAU: I already have...

EXT. UNDERPASS, GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

A CHINESE MAN finishes loading a TRACTOR TRAILER with cash
boxes.  The truck pulls out into a CONVOY.

INT. BANK VAULT -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon stands in an almost empty bank vault.  Furious.
28.
LAU: For obvious reasons I couldn't wait
for your permission...

INT. SOCIAL CLUB, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS

The shot of Lau on the TV widens...
LAU: Rest assured, your money is safe.
He is already on his private jet.
IN THE SKY: THE BAT SIGNAL.

EXT. ROOF, POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

Batman emerges from the shadows.  The man next to the glowing
spotlight turns: DENT.
DENT: You're a hard man to reach.
Gordon BURSTS onto the rooftop, weapon drawn.  Sees Dent.
DENT: Lau's halfway to Hong Kong- if you'd
asked, I could have taken his
passport- I told you to keep me in
the loop.
GORDON: Yeah?  All that was left in the
vaults were the marked bills- they
knew we were coming!  As soon as your
office got involved, there's a leak-
DENT: My office?!  You're sitting down here
with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez...
(off look)
Oh, yeah, Gordon- I almost had your
rookie cold on a racketeering beef.
GORDON: Don't try to cloud the fact that
clearly Maroni's got people in your
office, Dent.
Dent turns to Batman.
DENT: We need Lau back, but the Chinese
won't extradite a national under any
circumstances.
29.
BATMAN: If I get him to you, can you get him
to talk?
DENT: I'll get him to sing.
GORDON: We're going after the mob's life
savings.  Things will get ugly.
DENT: I knew the risks when I took this
job, lieutenant.  Same as you.
(turns to Batman)
How will you get him back, anyway?
Batman is gone.  Dent looks around, startled.  Gordon smirks.
GORDON: He does that.

INT. FOX'S OFFICE, WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- DAY

Fox gets up from behind his desk.
FOX: Our Chinese friend left town before I
could tell him the deal is off.
WAYNE: I'm sure you've always wanted to go
to Hong Kong.
Fox opens the door to a private elevator.

INT. PRIVATE ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS

Fox turns a key.
FOX: What's wrong with a phone call?
WAYNE: I think Mr.Lau deserves a more
personal touch.

INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- CONTINUOUS

Fox leads Wayne off the elevator and into the vast space.
FOX: For high altitude jumps, you need
oxygen and stabilizers.  I must say-
compared to your usual requests,
jumping out of an airplane is pretty
straightforward.
30.
Lucius stops at a cabinet, pulls open a drawer and hauls out
an oxygen tank and ribbed rubber hosing.
WAYNE: How about getting back into the
plane?
FOX: I can recommend a good travel agent.
WAYNE: Without it landing.
FOX: That's more like it, Mr.Wayne.
He shuts the drawer.  Moves off, thinking.
FOX: I don't think I have anything here.
The CIA had a program in the '60s for
getting their people out of hot
spots.  Called Sky Hook.  Now-
Fox opens a cabinet to reveal COMPONENTS OF A NEW BAT-SUIT.
ARMORED PLATING secured to mesh.  Wayne lifts an arm.
FOX: Hardened kevlar plates on a titanium-
dipped fiber tri-weave for
flexibility...
Wayne examines DOUBLE BLADE SCALLOPS on the gauntlet...
FOX: You'll be lighter, faster, more
agile...
Wayne flinches as the BLADES FIRE, SPINNING LIKE THROWING
STARS, NARROWLY MISSING his ear, embedding themselves in a
filing cabinet.  Fox looks at him.
FOX: Perhaps you should read the
instructions, first.
WAYNE: Sorry.
Fox picks up the chest, demonstrating its flexibility.
FOX: Now, there's a trade-off...  the
spread of the plates gives you weak
spots.  You'll be more vulnerable to
gunfire and knives.
31.
WAYNE: We wouldn't want things getting too
easy, would we?
(picks up suit)
How will it hold up against dogs?
Fox looks at him quizzically.
FOX: You talking chihuahuas or rotweilers?
(Wayne smiles)
It should do fine against cats.

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY

Wayne examines a parachute harness.  Alfred unfolds a diagram
of a NAVY CARGO PLANE with a giant "V" mounted on the front.
ALFRED: I found one.  In Arizona.  Very nice
man says it will take him a week to
get it running.  And he takes cash.
What about a flight crew?
WAYNE: South Korean smugglers.  They run
flights into Pyongyang, below radar
the whole way.  Did you think of an
alibi?
Alfred looks quite pleased with himself.
ALFRED: Oh, yes.

EXT. BALLET -- NIGHT

Rachel and Dent arrive to find the box office SHUTTERED.  A
sign:'PERFORMANCE CANCELED.'  A newspaper story is taped to
the glass.  Over a picture of BRUCE WAYNE ON A YACHT: LOVE BOAT- Billionaire absconds with entire Moscow ballet.

EXT. DECK, WAYNE'S YACHT, THE CARIBBEAN -- DAY

Alfred, picks his way over twelve SUNBATHING BALLERINAS.
Wayne looks up from a newspaper.  Alfred points to a SEA-
PLANE gently touching down across the bay.
ALFRED: I believe your plane is here.
WAYNE: You look tired, Alfred.  Will you be
all right without me?
A Ballerina rolls over- waves the suntan lotion at Alfred.
32.
ALFRED: If you can tell me the Russian for
'apply your own bloody suntan
lotion.’
Wayne tosses a large, waterproof kit bag into the water and
JUMPS in after it.  Begins swimming over to the sea-plane.

INT. POOL HALL -- NIGHT

Gambol racks up.  A bodyguard steps into the room.
BODYGUARD: Somebody here for you.
Gambol looks to the back- three rough customers are waiting.
BODYGUARD: They say they've killed the Joker.
They've come for the reward.
GAMBOL: They bring proof?
BODYGUARD: They say they've brought the body.
The bodyguards FLOP a BODY wrapped in garbage bags onto the
table.  The BOUNTY HUNTERS wait in the corner.  Gambol pulls
back one of the garbage bags, revealing the Joker's bloodied
face.  Gambol spits.  Turns to face the bounty hunters.
GAMBOL: So.  Dead you get five hundred-
Behind Gambol, the Joker SITS UP- THRUSTS knives into the
bodyguards' chests.  Gambol spins to see a crazy grin on the
Joker's spit-dribbled face-
THE JOKER: How about alive?
The Joker gets a switchblade in Gambol's mouth- SHARP METAL
PULLING THE CHEEK TAUT.  The Bounty Hunters subdue the
remaining bodyguards.
THE JOKER: Wanna know how I got these scars?  My
father was a drinker and a fiend.
He'd beat mommy right in front of me.
One night he goes off crazier than
usual, mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.  He doesn't like
that.  Not.  One.  Bit.
The Joker TUGS Gambols cheek with the blade.
33.
THE JOKER: So, me watching, he takes the knife
to her, laughing while he does it.
Turns to me and says 'why so
serious?'  Comes at me with the knife-
'why so serious?'  Sticks the blade
in my mouth- 'Let's put a smile on
that face' and...
The Joker looks up at the ASHEN FACES of the remaining Body
Guards.  Smiles.
THE JOKER: Why so serious?
The Joker FLICKS his wrist- the Body Guards flinch as Gambol
goes down.  The Joker turns to them.
THE JOKER: Now, our organization is small, but
we've got a lot of potential for
aggressive expansion... so which of
you fine gentlemen would like to join
our team?
The three bodyguards all nod.  The Joker SNAPS a pool cue.
THE JOKER: Only one slot open right now- so
we're going to have try-outs.
The Joker drops the broken cue in the middle of the men.
THE JOKER: Make it fast.
The men stare at each other.  Then at the jagged pool cue.

EXT.PENINSULA HOTEL, HONG KONG -- DAY

A HELICOPTER touches down on one of the hotel's twin
helipads.  Two L.S.I. VPs approach, heads ducked.  Fox gets
out- they shake hands, shouting over the engine-
VP: Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr.Fox!  Mr.Lau
regrets he is unable to meet you in
person.  But with his current legal
difficulties...!
FOX: I understand!

INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY

The VPs usher Fox towards security.
34.
VP: I'm afraid for security reasons I
have to ask for your mobile phone.
Lucius hands his phone to a SECURITY GUARD, who puts the
phone in a box underneath his station.

INT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY

Fox and Lau eat lunch in a dining room overlooking the city.
LAU: I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.
This misunderstanding with the Gotham
police force...  I couldn't let such
a thing threaten my company.  A
businessman of your stature will
understand.  But with you here... we
can continue.
FOX: Well, it was good of you to bring me
out here in such style, Mr.Lau.
But
I've actually come...
A CELL PHONE rings.  Fox pulls out a second, identical,
phone.  Fox presses the off switch and places the phone by
his plate.
LAU: We do not allow cell phones in-
FOX: Sorry.  Forgot I had it.  So, I've
come to explain why we're going to
have to put our deal on hold...
Lau stares at Fox.  Clearly furious.  Fox smiles.
FOX: We can't afford to be seen to do
business with... well, whatever it is
you're accused of being.  A
businessman of your stature will
understand.
Lau gets up.  Silent.  Fox retrieves his phone.  Stands.
LAU: (cold)
I think, Mr.Fox, that a simple phone
call might have sufficed.
35.
FOX: Well, I do love Chinese food.  And
Mr.Wayne didn't want you to think
we'd been deliberately wasting your
time.
LAU: Just accidentally wasting it.
FOX: (laughs)
That's very good- "accidentally".
Very good.  I'll be sure and tell
Mr.Wayne that he was wrong about you
not having a sense of humor.

INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY

Lucius walks back through security.  Nods at the VP, who
bows, offering Lucius his cell phone.  Lucius shakes his
head, holds up the IDENTICAL PHONE.  The VP smiles, nods,
puts the phone back into the tray with several others.

INT. HOLD, C-130 CARGO HAULER -- DAWN

Two SMUGGLERS steal glances at Wayne, crouched at the rear in
balaclava and flight suit.  The COPILOT signals Wayne, who
pulls on his oxygen mask and stands up.  The rear of the
plane OPENS.  Wayne steps to the edge, then JUMPS.

EXT. SKIES ABOVE HONG KONG -- DAWN

Moving across the water towards Hong Kong harbor...
A tiny figure DROPS into frame, PLUMMETING towards the water-
SPEEDING past the highest floors of skyscrapers, seconds from
impact.  Wayne PULLS the chute- DROPS into the water...

EXT. BENEATH FREEWAY, HONG KONG HARBOR -- DAY

Wayne pulls himself out of the water, dragging up his pack.

EXT. CENTRAL ESCALATORS -- DAY

Wayne stops halfway up the crowded commuter escalator.  He
takes a camera and lines up a shot like any tourist.
FOX (O.S.): There's a better view from the peak
tram.
Wayne turns to find Fox standing there, street map out.
WAYNE: How's the view from L.S.I.Holdings?
36.
FOX: Restricted.  Lau's holed up in there
good and tight.  Here...
Fox shows Wayne the phone.  The display: a 3-d map of Lau's
office suite.  Wayne takes the phone, impressed.
WAYNE: What's this?
FOX: I had R and D work it up- it sends
out high frequencies and records the
response time to map an environment.
WAYNE: (smiles)
Sonar.  Just like a b-
FOX: Submarine.  Like a submarine.
WAYNE: And the other device?
FOX: In place.
Wayne nods, moves away.
FOX: Mr.Wayne?
(Wayne turns)
Good luck.

EXT. HONG KONG -- NIGHT

Moving towards the tallest building in the glittering skyline
to find Wayne, crouched on the roof.  The blades of his
gauntlets CLICK into place.  He dons the helmet-like cowl.
His "cape" is in the form of a hard faceted PACK.
He stands- pulls two black boxes from his belt, CLICKS them
together and UNFOLDS them into a RIFLE-LIKE DEVICE.  Batman
SCOPES a second, lower building.  Adjust a setting and FIRES-
four times...
Four small STICKY BOMBS SLAP onto the glass of the lower
building.  They have visible timers which are COUNTING DOWN.

INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

Lucius' cell phone GLOWS in the box under the Security
Guard's desk.  CHARACTERS race across the screen.
Then the monitor FLICKERS off, the lights DIM and all of the
security doors in the front of the building OPEN at once.
37.
The Guard grabs his radio- CALLS FOR HELP...

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING L.S.I.HOLDINGS

Batman LAUNCHES into the glittering night, DROPPING from the
tall tower... his pack BURSTS OPEN, becoming his BAT WINGS-he
GLIDES down to the lower building, STREAKING around it,
BANKING HARD to line up with a window in the rear...

INT. LAU'S OFFICE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

Lau is talking on the phone, staring at a profit projection
on a flat screen monitor.  Suddenly the room goes dark.

EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- CONTINUOUS

As Batman HURTLES towards the glass he COLLAPSES his wings,
WRAPPING his cape around himself and CANNONBALLING THROUGH
THE GLASS-:

INT. LAU'S OFFICE SUITE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

-ROLLING across the floor in a flurry of broken glass...

INT. LAU'S OFFICE, TOP FLOOR, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

Lau pulls out a HANDGUN.

INT. HALLWAY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

Lau steps into the hallway.  His BODYGUARDS are waiting for
him, carrying FLASHLIGHTS.
LAU: Where the hell are the cops?
BODYGUARD: Coming.
LAU: What the hell am I paying them for?
They head for the stairwell.

EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

A small ARMY of Hong Kong police lead by a HONG KONG
DETECTIVE descends on the building.

INT. MEZZANINE LEVEL, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

Lau and his men make their way out onto the mezzanine.
Across the room, something makes a CRASHING SOUND.  Lau's men
fan out, trying to cover the room with their flashlights.
Suddenly, one of the flashlights goes DARK.  Then another.
Someone SCREAMS.
38.
Lau FIRES.  Then FIRES again.  The muzzle flash from his
weapon STROBES the room.

EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS, HONG KONG -- NIGHT

Cops SWARM into the building.  A LOBBY SECURITY GUARD directs
the Hong Kong Detective where to go...

INT. OFFICE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT

Lau LOCKS the door.  RELOADS.  The door is KICKED open.  Lau
FIRES.  No one is there.
Lau stares, finger restless on the trigger.  From his right-
a NOISE.  He turns and FIRES.
In the muzzle FLASH: Batman, bearing down on him like a
demon.
Lau FIRES, and FIRES again as Batman TACKLES him.  Batman
pulls out a SMALL PACK- STRAPS it onto Lau-
The COUNTER on the sticky bombs hits 0-
The Hong Kong Detective and the Cops BURST into the room- the
WALL AND CEILING BEHIND BATMAN AND LAU EXPLODES- revealing
the dawn sky above Hong Kong.
The Detective looks around as he hears a LOW RUMBLE...
Batman JERKS the RIPCORD on Lau's pack.  Cops cower as a
WEATHER BALLOON EXPLODES out of the pack, unreeling high-test
nylon.  The Cops cock their weapons.
Lau looks up.  Bemused.  The weather balloon is two hundred
feet up, swaying gently.  The RUMBLE BUILDS...
Suddenly, a MASSIVE C-130 ROARS over.  The large V on the
front of the plane SNAGS the line- Lau and BATMAN are YANKED
THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE CEILING-
Lau SCREAMS as he and Batman SOAR UP INTO THE DAWN SKY...
The Detective looks up.  Batman and Lau are gone.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Gordon is looking through case files.  Ramirez walks in.
RAMIREZ: You're gonna want to see this.

EXT. MCU -- DAY

Gordon follows Ramirez through a CROWD of excited cops.  On
the ground, trussed like a chicken- Lau.
A sign taped to his
chest: 'Please deliver to Lieutenant Gordon.'
39.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Lau sits next to his sleazy lawyer, EVANS.  Rachel walks in.
RACHEL: Give us the money and we'll deal.
LAU: The money is the only reason I'm
still alive.
Rachel leans forward, speaking softly.  Clearly.
RACHEL: You mean when they hear that you've
helped us they're going to kill you?
EVANS: Are you threatening my client?
RACHEL: No, I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.
As will everyone.
(moves to the door)
Enjoy your stay in County, Mr.Lau.
LAU: Wait.
(Rachel stops)
I won't give you the money, but I'll
give you my clients.  All of them.
RACHEL: You were a glorified accountant- what
could you have on all of them that we
could charge?
LAU: I'm good with calculation- I handled
all their investments.  One big pot.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Dent hits a buzzer.  Turns to Gordon.
DENT: I've got it.  RICO.  If their money
was pooled we can charge all of them
as one criminal conspiracy.
GORDON: Charge them with what?
Rachel enters.
40.
DENT: In a RICO case if we can charge any
of the conspirators with a felony-
RACHEL: We can charge all of them with it.
Dent nods at Rachel, excited.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Rachel comes back in.
RACHEL: Mr.Lau, do you have details of this
communal fund?  Ledgers,
notebooks...?
LAU: (smiles)
Immunity, protection and a chartered
plane back to Hong Kong.
RACHEL: Once you've testified in open court.
So with your clients locked up, what
happens to all that money?
LAU: Like I said- I'm good with
calculation.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS

Dent and Gordon watch Lau.
GORDON: He can't go to County.  I'll keep him
here in the holding cells.
DENT: What is this Gordon, your fortress?
GORDON: You trust them over at County?
DENT: I don't trust them here.
GORDON: Lau stays.
DENT: It's your call, Lieutenant.  Be
right.
GORDON: I am, counselor.
41.

EXT. CITY HALL -- DAY

Dent stands in front of a small crowd of reporters.
REPORTER: The Chinese government claim their
international rights have been
broken.
DENT: I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements...

INT. RESTAURANT -- CONTINUOUS

Dent's press conference plays on a TV in the corner.
DENT: (grins)
...but I'm sure glad he's back.
Maroni and the Chechen are watching the TV.
CHECHEN: I put word out.  We hire the clown.
(off look)
He was right.  We have to fix real
problem.  Batman.
Maroni shakes his head.  Spots Gordon walking over dangling a
pair of handcuffs.  Nods at the TV.
GORDON: Our boy looks good on the tube.
MARONI: You sure you want to embarrass me in
front of my friends, Lieutenant?
GORDON: Don't worry, they're coming, too.
Gordon points out the window to a PRISON BUS.

EXT. VARIOUS DOWNTOWN AND OUTLYING LOCATIONS -- DAY

Prison buses in every neighborhood.  COPS load them with
CRIMINALS.  Stephens puts Crime Boss in a prison bus.

INT. COURTROOM A, GOTHAM MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY

JUDGE SURRILLO reads the list of charges.
JUDGE SURRILLO: ...849 counts racketeering, 246
counts fraud, 87 counts conspiracy
murder...
42.
Judge Surrillo turns the page.  A PLAYING CARD sits there.  A
Joker.  He glances at it, curious,  puts it to one side.
JUDGE SURRILLO: ...how do the defendants plead?
An ARMY of DEFENSE LAWYERS jostle YELLING ALL AT ONCE.  The
STENOGRAPHER looks up, helpless.

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE -- DAY

The MAYOR, COMMISSIONER LOEB, and Gordon look up as Dent
enters.
MAYOR: DENT!  What was that circus?!
DENT: I asked Gordon to make some arrests.
LOEB: (looks at report)
Five hundred and-
GORDON: Forty-nine, sir.
Gordon nods at Dent, approving.  Dent grins back.
MAYOR: 549 criminals at once?!  How did you
convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
DENT: She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.
MAYOR: Even if you blow enough smoke to get
convictions out of Surrillo, you'll
set a new record at appeals for
quickest kick in the ass.
DENT: It won't matter.  The head guys make
bail, sure... but the mid-level guys,
they can't, and they can't afford to
be off the streets long enough for
trial and appeal.  They'll cut deals
that include some jail time.  Think
of all you could do with 18 months of
clean streets.
The Mayor waves Gordon and Loeb out.
MAYOR: The public likes you, Dent.  That's
the only reason this might fly.
43.
(MORE): But that means it's on you.  They're
all coming after you, now.  Not just
the mob... politicians, journalists,
cops- anyone whose wallet's about to
get lighter.  Are you up to it?
(Dent smiles)
You better be.  They get anything on
you... those criminals will be back
on the streets...
The Mayor turns to look out of the window.  Quiet.
MAYOR: Followed swiftly by you and me-
BANG!  A DARK SHAPE CRACKS THE GLASS in front of the Mayor's
nose.  Dent rushes to the window, looks out...

EXT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS

PEDESTRIANS look up, someone SCREAMS, someone POINTS- five
stories up... SWINGING from a FLAGPOLE...
BATMAN.  HANGING BY HIS NECK.  DEAD.  His mouth roughly
painted in a DEMONIC CLOWN SMILE.

EXT. CITY HALL -- MOMENTS LATER

"Batman" is lowered from the flagpole.  The same fake Batman
we saw earlier.  Pinned to his chest by a KNIFE, a PLAYING
CARD.  A Joker.  Gordon moves closer to the body.  The card
has writing on it: WILL THE REAL BATMAN PLEASE STAND UP?

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY

Wayne comes into the living room, excited.  Alfred is
supervising party arrangements.
WAYNE: How's it going?
ALFRED: I think your fundraiser will be a
great success, sir.
WAYNE: And why do you think I wanted to hold
a party for Harvey Dent?
ALFRED: I assumed it was your usual reason
for socialising beyond myself and the
scum of Gotham's underbelly: to try
and impress Miss Dawes.
WAYNE: Very droll.  But very wrong.
Actually it's Dent.  You see-
44.
MAYOR (cont'd)
Wayne trails off as he spots something on the television: the
Batman HANGING as from a NEWS CAMERA, framed by a graphic
that reads 'BATMAN DEAD?'.  Image cuts to Engel in the
studio.
ENGEL: ...Police released video footage
found concealed on the body.
Sensitive viewers be aware: it is
disturbing.
The image cuts to a BLINDFOLDED MAN, wearing a makeshift
Batman costume- face bruised and bloody.  In some kind of
bright, fluorescent-lit room.
VOICE: Tell them your name.
MAN: (weak)
Brian Douglas.
VOICE: Are you the real Batman?
MAN: No.
VOICE: Why do you dress up like him?
MAN: He's a symbol... that we don't have
to be afraid of scum like you...
VOICE: But you do, Brian.  You really do.
You think the Batman's helped Gotham?
Brian nods uncertainly...
VOICE: Look at me.
(Brian looks down)
LOOK AT ME!: Brian looks up- the camera swings into the face of the Joker,
in CHALK-WHITE makeup, RED SMEAR of lipstick on his SCARS.
THE JOKER: This is how crazy Batman's made
Gotham.
You want order in Gotham?
Batman has to go.  So...
(leans in)
Batman must take off his mask, and
turn himself in.
45.
(MORE): Every day he doesn't... people will
die.  Starting tonight.  I'm a man of
my word.
The tape cuts to STATIC.
Wayne turns to Alfred.  Silent.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- EVENING

Dent and Rachel get off the lift.  Dent stands in awe of the
penthouse and its guests.
RACHEL: Now I've seen it all: Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld, scared
stiff by the trust fund brigade.
Rachel spots someone and darts off-
DENT: Rachel-
ALFRED: A little liquid courage, Mr.Dent?
Dent turns to see Alfred with drinks on a silver tray.
DENT: Thanks.  Alfred, right?
ALFRED: Yes, sir.
DENT: Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life?
ALFRED: Not yet, sir.
DENT: (smiles, surveys crowd)
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should
be aware of?
ALFRED: Oh, you have no idea.
Alfred leaves Dent standing there, puzzled.  The crowd REACTS
as a LOUD ROAR drowns conversation... Dent looks out-

EXT. HELIPAD, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne's CHOPPER touches down.  He spills out with a clutch of
SUPERMODELS...: 46.
THE JOKER (cont'd)

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne and the supermodels come out of the helipad elevator-
WAYNE: Sorry, I'm late- glad you started
without me!  Where's Rachel?!
Rachel cringes slightly.  Wayne spots her.
WAYNE: Rachel Dawes- my oldest friend.  When
she told me she was dating Harvey
Dent, I had one thing to say...  the
guy from those god-awful campaign
commercials?
Laughter.  Dent shifts, embarrassed.
WAYNE: 'I Believe in Harvey Dent.'  Nice
slogan, Harvey.  Certainly caught
Rachel's attention.  But then I
started paying attention to Harvey,
and all he's been doing as our new
D.A., and you know what?  I believe
in Harvey Dent.  On his watch, Gotham
can feel a little safer.  A little
more optimistic.  So get out your
checkbooks and let's make sure that
he stays right where all of Gotham
wants him...
(raises his glass)
All except Gotham's criminals, of
course.  To the face of Gotham's
bright future- Harvey Dent.
Dent smiles accepting the toast.

INT. CORRIDOR, MCU -- EVENING

Ramirez catches up to Gordon, holding paperwork.
RAMIREZ: That Joker card pinned to the body?
Forensics found three sets of D.N.A..
GORDON: Any matches?
RAMIREZ: All three.
Gordon STOPS.  Turns to face her.
RAMIREZ: The D.N.A. belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.
47.
GORDON: The Joker's telling us who he's
targeting- get a unit to Surrillo's
house, tell Wuertz to find Dent- get
them both into protective custody.
Where's the Commissioner?
RAMIREZ: City hall.
GORDON: Seal the building.  No one in or out
till I get there.

EXT. DECK, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- EVENING

Wayne walks out to the edge of the balcony and looks over
Gotham.
Hears someone behind him- Rachel.
RACHEL: Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand when you're making fun
of him.  But I do.
WAYNE: (shakes his head)
I meant every word.
Wayne moves closer to Rachel.  Takes her arm.
WAYNE: The day you once told me about, the
day when Gotham no longer needs
Batman.  It's coming.
Rachel looks at Wayne.  Conflicted.  He moves closer.
RACHEL: You can't ask me to wait for that.
Wayne takes Rachel's arms, looking at her, excited.
WAYNE: It's happening now- Harvey is that
hero.  He locked up half the city's
criminals, and he did it without
wearing a mask.  Gotham needs a hero
with a face.
DENT: You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll
give you that.  Thanks again.  Mind
if I borrow Rachel?
Rachel glances back at Wayne as she moves to Dent.  Wayne
watches them head inside.
48.

EXT. STREET, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- EVENING

Two MEN in suits knock at a Brownstone.  The door is opened
by Judge Surrillo.
The two Men hold up BADGES.

EXT. CITY HALL -- EVENING

Gordon enters through a tight police presence at the doors.

INT. POLICE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE -- EVENING

Gordon enters to find Loeb, flanked by armed cops.
COMMISSIONER LOEB: Gordon, what are you playing at?
Gordon checks the window.  Turns to his men.
GORDON: We're secure.  I want a floor-by-
floor search of the entire building.
(turns to Loeb)
I'm sorry, sir.  We believe the Joker
has made a threat against your life.
LOEB: Gordon, you're unlikely to discover
this for yourself, so take my word-
the Police Commissioner earns a lot
of threats...
Loeb pulls a bottle of whisky and a tumbler from a drawer.
LOEB: I found the appropriate response to
these situations a long time ago...

EXT. STREET, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- EVENING

The second man is waiting by the Judge's car.
SURRILLO: Gordon wants me to go right now?
MAN 1: These are dangerous people, Judge.
Even we don't know where you're
going.
He hands Surrillo a sealed envelope.  Opens the car door.
MAN 2: Get in, then open the envelope.
It'll tell you where you're headed.
Surrillo climbs in.  Watches them drive away.  She opens the
envelope- pulls out a sheet of paper.  One word on it: 49.
'UP'.: Surrillo's car EXPLODES, heaving the car upwards on a
FIREBALL.: A PASSERBY is thrown to the ground.  After a moment, BURNING
DEBRIS flutters down on him.  PLAYING CARDS.  JOKERS.

INT. POLICE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Loeb pours himself a glass of whisky.
LOEB: You get to explain to my wife why I'm
late for dinner, Lieutenant.
GORDON: Sir, the Joker card had a trace of
your D.N.A. on it-
A bang at the door.  Gordon pulls his weapon, then opens it.
STEPHENS: Just the normal number of bad guys in
the building- and they're all city
employees.  Here's a list.
LOEB: How'd they get my D.N.A.?
Gordon looks at Stephens's list.
GORDON: Somebody with access to your house or
office must've lifted a tissue or a
glass...
Gordon, realizing, spins around-
GORDON: Wait-
But Loeb is already CHOKING- he DROPS his tumbler onto the
desk- the spilled whiskey is SMOKING, eating into the wood.
GORDON: Get a medic!
Loeb COLLAPSES.

INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- EVENING

Dent pulls Rachel into the kitchen, away from the crowd.
DENT: You cannot leave me on my own with
these people.
50.
RACHEL: The whole mob's after you and you're
worried about these guys?
DENT: Compared to this, the mob doesn't
scare me.  Although, I will say: them
gunning for you makes you see things
clearly.
RACHEL: Oh, yeah?
DENT: Yeah.  It makes you think about what
you couldn't stand losing.  And who
you want to spend the rest of your
life with...
Rachel looks at Dent.  Smiles.
RACHEL: The rest of your life, huh?  That's a
pretty big commitment.
DENT: Not if the mob has their way.
RACHEL: Don't.
DENT: Okay.  Let's be serious.  What's your
answer?
Rachel looks at him.
RACHEL: I don't have an answer.

INT.LIVING ROOM, PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

Half the guests are on their cell phones.  An ASSISTANT DA
turns to his COLLEAGUE.
ASSISTANT DA: Surrillo and Loeb?
There is a KNOCK at the front door.  Alfred opens it it find
Detective Wuertz, who holds up his badge.  Alfred beckons him
in- there is a SHOTGUN at the back of his head held by-
The Joker- purple suit, make up.  With friends.  The Joker
SMASHES Wuertz over the head- steps over him, RACKING the
shotgun.
51.
THE JOKER: Good evening.  We're the
entertainment.

INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

Rachel is looking at Dent.  Torn.
DENT: I guess no answer isn't "no".
RACHEL: I'm sorry, Harvey.  I just...
DENT: It's someone else, isn't it?
Wayne is moving up behind him.  Fast-
DENT: Just tell me it's not Wayne.  The
guy's a complete-
Rachel's eyes go wide as Wayne puts Dent in a SLEEPER HOLD-
RACHEL: What are you doing?!
Dent SLUMPS, unconscious in Wayne's arms.
WAYNE: They've come for him.
From the main room- A SHOTGUN BLAST followed by SCREAMS.
Wayne stuffs Dent in a closet- puts a mop through the
handles.  Rushes past Rachel-
WAYNE: Stay hidden.

INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

The Joker and his THUGS pour into the room, weapons raised.

INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

A THUG appears in front of Wayne, toting a shotgun.
THUG: Hands up, pretty boy.
Wayne FLIPS the shotgun around in the man's hands- uses it as
a fulcrum to SNAP his forearm- SMASHES him in the jaw with
the stock without breaking step, field stripping the shotgun
and tossing the pieces in different directions.
52.

INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

The Joker moves through the terrified guests.  Smiling.
THE JOKER: I only have one question: where is
Harvey Dent?
(silence)
I'll settle for his loved ones...
A distinguished Gentleman steps into the Joker's path.
GENTLEMAN: We're not intimidated by thugs.
The Joker stops.  Stares at the man.  SMILES AFFECTIONATELY.
THE JOKER: You know, you remind me of my father.
(GRABS him)
I hated my father.
The Joker has his blade in the Gentleman's mouth.
RACHEL: Stop!
The Joker drops the Gentleman.  Turns to Rachel.
THE JOKER: Hello, beautiful.  You must be
Harvey's squeeze.
(runs his knife across her
cheek)
And you are beautiful.  You look
nervous- it's the scars isn't it?
Wanna know how I got them?  I had a
wife,  beautiful like you.  Who tells
me I worry too much.  Who says I need
to smile more.  Who gambles.  And
gets in deep with the sharks.  One
day they carve her face, and we've
got no money for surgeries.  She
can't take it.
(presses knife into her
cheek)
I just want to see her smile again.
I just want her to know I don't care
about the scars.  So I put a razor in
my mouth and do this to myself...
And you know what?
(starts laughing)
She can't stand the sight of me...
(or crying)
She leaves!  See, now I see the funny
side.  Now I'm always smiling.
53.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

Wayne walks in.  A COUPLE are hastily putting themselves back
together, alerted by the noise.
MALE GUEST: What's going on out there, Wayne?
Wayne doesn't answer.  He walks into a closet and pulls at a
FALSE WALL.  Wayne steps into the safe room.
FEMALE GUEST: Thank god- you've got a panic room.
The door SLAMS shut and seals with a HISS.
MALE GUEST: Wait!  You can't-
FEMALE GUEST: You've got to be kidding me.

INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

The Joker raises his knife from Rachel's cheek.  She SLUGS
him.  He smiles.
THE JOKER: A little fight in you.  I like that.
BATMAN: Then you're going to love me.
The Joker turns.  Batman catches him with a BLOW, spins him
down and DISARMS him- the Joker's men jump him- Batman takes
them out two at a time-  DISARMING thugs- BREAKING forearms-
the Joker CLICKS a BLADE from the toe of his shoe and KICKS-
JABBING BETWEEN THE PLATES OF ARMOR covering Batman's ribcage-
Batman HURLS the Joker across the room.  One of the Joker's
men LUNGES- Batman lays him out cold.
The Joker has another knife pressed to Rachel's neck.
BATMAN: Drop the knife.
THE JOKER: Sure.  Just take off your mask and
show us all who you are...
Rachel shakes her head at Batman.  The Joker raises his
shotgun to the side and BLOWS OUT the pane of glass next to
him.  The Joker dangles Rachel out the window.
BATMAN: Let her go.
54.
THE JOKER: (laughs)
Very poor choice of words...
He lets her DROP-  Rachel falls onto a SLOPING GLASS ROOF-
sliding towards the edge Batman DIVES after her-

EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT

They DROP- Batman FIRES his grapple, SNAGGING Rachel's ankle-
activates one wing of his cape- They SPIN and SLOW- Batman
envelopes Rachel- they SLAM into the hood of a passing taxi.

INT. TAXI -- CONTINUOUS

The DRIVER SCREAMS as Batman and Rachel hit the roof- ROLL
down the windshield- onto the pavement.  Alive.

INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS

The Joker looks back as his car SPEEDS away.  He's breathing
hard, EXHILARATED.  He touches the blood running down his
sweaty white makeup.  SMACKS the back of the driver's seat-
DRIVER: What do we do about Dent?
THE JOKER: I'm a man of my word.

EXT. TAXI -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel opens her eyes.
BATMAN: Are you alright?
RACHEL: Let's not do that again, okay?
(looks around)
Is Harvey-?
BATMAN: He's safe.
Rachel lies back, breathing.  Looks up at Batman.
RACHEL: Thank you.

INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

STEPHENS is talking to Gordon, subdued.
STEPHENS: Jim, it's over.
55.
GORDON: As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.
STEPHENS: But the prosecution's over.
STEPHENS: No-one's standing up in front of a
Judge while judges and police
commissioners are getting blown away.
GORDON: What about Dent?
STEPHENS: If he's got any sense, Dent's halfway
to Mexico by now.
The door BURSTS OPEN.  Dent.  Fire in his eyes.
DENT: So where do you keep your trash?
Gordon looks at Dent.  Impressed.

INT. SPECIAL HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Lau looks up as Dent walks in, holding a bullet proof vest.
DENT: You're due in court- I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.
LAU: No way.  You can't protect me- you
can't even protect yourselves.
Dent THROWS the heavy vest at Lau.
DENT: Refuse to cooperate on the stand- you
won't be coming back here- you'll go
to county.  How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY

Wayne sits at his video screens- they all play the Joker's
video with different IMAGE TREATMENTS and SOUND TUNINGS.
Wayne turns to Alfred.  Indicates the screens.
WAYNE: Targeting me won't get their money
back.  I knew the mob wouldn't go
down without a fight, but this is
different.  They've crossed a line.
56.
ALFRED: You crossed it first, sir.  You've
hammered them, squeezed them to the
point of desperation.  And now, in
their desperation they've turned to a
man they don't fully understand.
Wayne gets up from his monitors, raises the bat-cabinet.
WAYNE: Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.
We just have to figure out what he's
after.
ALFRED: Respectfully, Master Wayne, perhaps
this is a man you don't fully
understand, either.
ALFRED: (looks at Wayne)
I was in Burma.  A long time ago.  My
friends and I were working for the
local government.  They were trying
to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders,
bribing them with precious stones.
But their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a
bandit.  We were asked to take care
of the problem,  so we started
looking for the stones.  But after
six months, we couldn't find anyone
who had traded with him.
WAYNE: What were you missing?
ALFRED: One day I found a child playing with
a ruby as big as a tangerine.
(shrugs)
The bandit had been throwing the
stones away.
WAYNE: So why was he stealing them?
ALFRED: Because he thought it was good sport.
Because some men aren't looking for
anything logical, like money... they
can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or
negotiated with.
(grave)
Some men just want to watch the world
burn.
Wayne stares at Alfred.  Reaches for the bat-suit.
57.

EXT. SKYLINE OF GOTHAM -- DAWN

MOVING over the city we hear myriad RADIO CALLS going out
over the ether.  CLOSE IN on a lonely figure on top of a
skyscraper.  The Batman.  Listening with his million dollar
earpieces.  From the babble, ONE VOICE EMERGES.
DISPATCH (O.S.): Your name, sir.  Please state-
VOICE (O.S.): 8th at orchard.  You'll find Harvey
Dent there.

EXT. 8TH STREET AT ORCHARD -- DAWN

An UNMARKED and a SQUAD CAR screech to a halt.  Gordon and
Ramirez get out, lead two UNIFORMS into the building.

INT. APARTMENT, EIGHT AVE. -- CONTINUOUS

The door SMASHES OPEN, Gordon- gun drawn- takes in the scene.
TWO DEAD MEN sitting at the kitchen table.  They each have a
HAND OF CARDS, as if in the middle of a game.  ALL JOKERS.
Gordon and Ramirez STARE at the CRUDE LEERS carved into their
faces.  Their DRIVERS LICENSES are pinned to their chests.
VOICE: Check the names.
GORDON: (checks licenses)
Patrick Harvey.  Richard Dent...
RAMIREZ: Harvey Dent.
BATMAN: I need ten minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.
RAMIREZ: Us contaminate it?  It's because of
you that these guys are dead in the
first place-
GORDON: Ramirez.
She stands down.  Batman moves past the bodies to the wall.
Finds an embedded stray bullet.  He pulls a SAWING DEVICE
from his belt- THRUSTS it into the wall and starts cutting
around the bullet.
GORDON: That's brick- you're gonna try and
take ballistics off a shattered
bullet?
58.
BATMAN: No.  Fingerprints.
Ramirez looks at Gordon.  Is he serious?  Gordon points-
GORDON: Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast,
'cos we know his next target...
Batman looks- a campaign poster: RE-ELECT MAYOR GARCIA.  The
Mayor's image has a MANIC CLOWN'S GRIN and "HA,HA,HA".

INT. FOX'S OFFICE, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY

Fox is at his desk.  Reese enters.
FOX: What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?
REESE: You asked me to do the diligence on
the L.S.I.Holdings deal again.  I
found irregularities.
FOX: Their CEO is in police custody.
REESE: Not with their numbers.  With yours.
A whole division of Wayne Industries
disappeared, overnight.  So I went
down to the archives and started
pulling old files.
He pulls out a folded blueprint.  Slides it across the desk.
REESE: My kids love the Batman.  I thought
he was pretty cool, too.  Out there,
kicking some ass.
Fox picks up the piece of paper.  Unfolds it.  It's an old
BLUEPRINT.  The image is unmistakable: THE TUMBLER.
REESE: Changes things when you know it's
just a rich kid playing dress up.
Reese points to the approval box in the corner of the page.
REESE: Your project.  Don't tell me you
didn't recognize your baby pancaking
cop cars on the evening news.  Now
you're getting sloppy.  Applied
Sciences was a small, dead department-
who'd notice?
59.
(MORE): But now you've got the entire R and D
department burning cash, claiming
it's related to cell phones for the
army.  What are you building him now?
A rocket ship? I want ten million a
year.  For the rest of my life.
Fox looks at him.  Even.  Folds up the blueprint.
FOX: Let me get this straight.  You think
that your client, one of the
wealthiest and most powerful men in
the world, is secretly a vigilante
who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare
hands...
(deadpan)
And now your plan is to blackmail
this person?
Reese stares at Fox.  Who smiles.  And slides the blueprint
across the desk.
FOX: Good luck.
Reese looks at it.  Then at Fox.  Swallows.  Slides it back.

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY

Wayne hands Alfred a  RIFLE BULLET scribed with a GRID.  He
slots it into a clip, then loads it into a COMPUTER
CONTROLLED GATTLING GUN.  He puts on ear protectors.  Hits a
button.
The rifle WHIRS to life- dollying sideways, BLASTING BULLETS
into a series of identical BRICK WALL SAMPLES.
ALFRED: I'm not sure you made it loud enough,
sir.
As the wall samples still smoke, Wayne steps up, carrying the
sample from the crime scene. Comparing its spread to the new
samples, he selects two and carries them to an X-RAY SCANNER.
The machine gives the samples a 3-axis scan- HI-RES 3-D
IMAGES of the bullet fragment arrays come up on the screen...

INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- DAY

The same image of the bullet fragment on a screen.  Fox hits
a key and the computer 'reassembles' the bullets according to
the identifying grid on each fragment.
FOX: Here's your original scan...
60.
REESE (cont'd)
A bullet fragment array pops on screen.
FOX: Here's it reverse-engineered...
Fox hits a button and the unmarked bullet fragments are
reassembled.  Wayne spins the roughly-shaped bullet puzzle-
WAYNE: And here's a thumb print.
Fox looks at the screen, impressed.  Thinks.
FOX: I'll make you a copy.
(troubled)
Mr.Wayne, did you reassign R and D?
WAYNE: Yes.  Government telecommunications
project.
FOX: I wasn't aware we had any new
government contracts.  Can you-
WAYNE: Lucius.
I'm playing this one pretty
close to the chest.
FOX: Fair enough.
Fox looks at Wayne as he leaves.  Uneasy.

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- CONTINUOUS -- INTERCUT

Wayne examines the fingerprint-
WAYNE: I've run it through all the databases
and came up with four possibles.
Wayne gets up to let Alfred sit.
WAYNE (CONT’D): Cross-reference the addresses.
Look for Parkside and around.
Wayne opens a HYDRAULIC DOOR, revealing a gleaming MV AUGUSTA
BRUTALE.: As he moves the bike onto the lift...
ALFRED: Got one.  Melvin White, aggravated
assault, moved to Arkham twice- 1502
Randolph Apartments, just off State-
61.
WAYNE: Overlooking the parade.
Wayne and the bike rise on the lift.

EXT. PARKSIDE AVENUE -- DAY

The avenue has been blocked off.  Onlookers line the
sidewalks.  POLICE march past in dress uniform.  Engel does a
stand-up on the sidewalk.
ENGEL: With no word from the Batman- even as
they mourn Commissioner Loeb, these
cops have to be wondering if the
Joker is going to make good on his
threat to kill the Mayor today...
On the buildings above, POLICE SNIPERS scan the crowd.
Gordon keys his radio-
GORDON: How's it looking up top?
POLICE SNIPER: We're tight.  But frankly... there's
a lot of windows up here.
Gordon looks up at the myriad buildings overlooking the
podium.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne maneuvers the Ducati through the traffic.  He pulls up
near a parade barricade- dismounts and slips into an alley.

safety.

DENT: Tell me what you know about the
Joker.
63.
The Joker's thug looks at Dent.  Smirks.  Dent looks down.
Exasperated.  Looks back up at the Joker's Thug.  Spots
something- moves closer- the man's uniform... his name tag...
OFFICER RACHEL DAWES.: Dent, breathing hard, looks around: the paramedic jumps out,
rushing to help a FALLEN OFFICER.  Dent spies the keys in the
ignition.  Jumps into the driver's seat...

Barbara Gordon stands in the doorway, scared.  Stephens and a
UNIFORMED OFFICER stand in front of her.

James stays just inside the door.
STEPHENS: I'm sorry.
Barbara stares at Stephens.  Then looks past him.
BARBARA: Are you out there?!  Are you?!
James spots something- Batman, perched in the shadows.
BARBARA: You brought this on us!  This
craziness!  You did!  You brought
this...!
She collapses into Stephens's arms.  Batman hangs his head.

EXT. ROOF, MCU -- NIGHT

Detectives from MCU stand around the lit bat-signal.
STEPHENS: Switch it off- he ain't coming.

help whoever he does want to talk to-

Strobe lights.  Pounding music.  Maroni is in a booth at the
side with his MISTRESS.  His bodyguards are around the table.
64.
MISTRESS: (shouting over music)
Can't we go someplace quieter!  We
can't hear each other talk!
MARONI: I don't wanna hear you talk.
MISTRESS: (can't hear)
What?!
One of Maroni's Bodyguards DROPS- Maroni looks over- in the
strobe lights- Batman SAVAGES his bodyguards- people RUN,
TERRIFIED.  Maroni starts to get out of his seat- Batman
LANDS like a panther on the table in front of him-

INT. MCU -- NIGHT

Rachel moves through the chaotic bullpen at MCU-
EYEWITNESSES, civilian and cop are being questioned.
Rachel's phone rings.
RACHEL: Harvey, where are you?!
INTERCUT with Dent in an INDISTINCT interior setting.
DENT: Where are you?
RACHEL: Where you should be- at Major Crimes
trying to sort through all the-
DENT: Rachel, listen to me.  You're not
safe there.
RACHEL: This is Gordon's unit, Harvey-
DENT: Gordon's gone, Rachel.
RACHEL: He vouched for these men-
DENT: And he's gone.  The Joker's named you
next.
Rachel looks around the bullpen.  Eyeing the detectives.
DENT: Rachel, I can't let anything happen
to you.  I love you too much.
65.
(MORE): Is there someone, anyone in this city
we can trust?
RACHEL: Bruce.  We can trust Bruce Wayne.
DENT: Rachel, I know he's your friend but-
RACHEL: Trust me, Harvey, Bruce's penthouse
is now the safest place in the city.
DENT: Okay.  Go straight there.  Don't tell
anyone where you're going.  I'll find
you there.
Wider shows us we are-

INT. BASEMENT, CONDEMNED BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

blindfold...

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT

Maroni opens his eyes.  Batman is holding him by the collar.
BATMAN: I want the Joker.
MARONI: (looks down)
From one professional to another-if
you're trying to scare someone, pick
a better spot.  From this height the
fall wouldn't kill me.
BATMAN: I'm counting on it.
Batman lets go.  Maroni FALLS.  And SCREAMS.

EXT. SIDEWALK -- NIGHT

Maroni NAILS the pavement.  CLUTCHES at his leg, which is
badly broken.  Batman FLIES down, landing over him- hauls him
up.  Maroni HOLLERS in pain.
BATMAN: Where is he?
MARONI: I don't know, he found us-
66.
DENT (cont'd)
BATMAN: He must have friends.
MARONI: Friends?  You met this guy?
BATMAN: Someone knows where he is.
Maroni looks up at Batman.  Sneering.
MARONI: No one's gonna tell you anything-
they're wise to your act- you got
rules... the Joker, he's got no
rules.  No one's gonna cross him for
you.  You want this guy, you got one
way.  And you already know what that
is.  Just take off that mask and let
him come find you.
Batman DROPS Maroni.
MARONI: Or you want to let a couple more
people get killed while you make up
your mind?

INT. BASEMENT, CONDEMNED BUILDING -- NIGHT

Dent shows the Joker's Thug a GUN.  Bullets.  Loads the gun.
SHOVES it in his face-
DENT: You wanna play games?
Dent PUSHES the gun against the thug's head with REAL MALICE.
Pulls it away and FIRES.  The Thug FLINCHES.  Dent puts the
gun barrel against the thug's temple-
JOKER'S THUG: (rattled)
You wouldn't...
And pulls his lucky coin out of his pocket.
DENT: No.  I wouldn't.  That's why I'm not
going to leave it up to me.
(shows him coin)
Heads- you get to keep your head.
Tails... not so lucky.  So, you want
to tell me about the Joker?
The Thug, scared, says nothing.  Dent FLICKS the coin into
the air.  SLAPS it onto the back of his gun hand (aiming with
wrist horizontal).  Dent shows him the coin.  Heads.  The
Thug exhales, SHAKING.
67.
DENT: Go again?
JOKER'S THUG: (sobbing)
I don't know anything!
DENT: You're not playing the odds, friend.
Dent tosses the coin again.  This time IT DOESN'T LAND.  Dent
looks up.  Batman is there.
BATMAN: You'd leave a man's life to chance?
DENT: Not exactly.
BATMAN: His name's Schiff, Thomas.  He's a
paranoid schizophrenic, a former
patient at Arkham.
The kind of mind
the Joker attracts.
Batman moves away from Schiff.
BATMAN: What do expect to learn from him?
Dent is shivering with frustration.
DENT: The Joker killed Gordon- and, and
Loeb.
He's going to kill Rachel...
BATMAN: You're the symbol of hope that I
could never be.  Your stand against
organized crime is the first
legitimate ray of light in Gotham for
decades.  If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone- all the
criminals you got off the streets
would be released.  And Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.
Batman hands Dent his lucky coin.
BATMAN: You're going to call a press
conference.  Tomorrow morning.
DENT: Why?
68.
BATMAN: No one else will die because of me.
Gotham is in your hands, now.
DENT: You can't!  You can't give in!
But Batman is gone.

INT. BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT

Rachel watches Gotham through the window.  Wayne enters.
RACHEL: Harvey called.  He says Batman is
going to turn himself in.
WAYNE: I have no choice.
RACHEL: You honestly think it's going to stop
the Joker from killing?
WAYNE: Perhaps not.  But I've got enough
blood on my hands.  I've seen, now,
what I would have to become to stop
men like him.
Rachel looks at Wayne.  She cannot help him.
WAYNE: You once told me that if the day came
when I was finished...
Wayne moves towards her.
WAYNE: We'd be together.
RACHEL: Bruce, don't make me your one hope
for a normal life-
Wayne takes her in his arms.
WAYNE: But did you mean it?
RACHEL: Yes.
They kiss.  Then separate.  She looks sadly into his eyes.
RACHEL: But they won't let us be together
after you turn yourself in.
69.
Wayne nods.  Leaves.  She watches him go.

INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAWN

Alfred shovels DOCUMENTS into an incinerator- blueprints,
designs, files.  He pauses, looking down at a book.
ALFRED: Even the logs?
WAYNE: Anything that could lead back to
Lucius or Rachel.
Alfred tosses the book onto the fire.  STARES at Wayne.
WAYNE: People are dying, Alfred.  What would
you have me do?
Alfred looks into Wayne's eyes with a fearsome gaze.
ALFRED: Endure, Master Wayne.  Take it.
They'll hate you for it, but that's
the point of Batman... he can be the
outcast.  He can make the choice no
one else can face.  The right choice.
Wayne shakes his head.
WAYNE: Today I've found out what Batman
can't do.  He can't endure this.
(rueful smile)
Today you get to say 'I told you so'.
ALFRED: Today, I don't want to.
(beat)
Although I did bloody tell you.
Wayne sinks the Bat-suit, Alfred closes the incinerator.
They head for the lift.
ALFRED: I suppose they'll lock me up as well.
Your accomplice.
WAYNE: Accomplice?  I'm going to tell them
the whole thing was your idea.
They power down, leaving the Bat-bunker in darkness.
70.

INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY

A capacity crowd of REPORTERS, COPS, and PUBLIC.  Dent is at
the podium.  Wayne sits in the crowd.
DENT: Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for
coming.  I've called this press
conference for two reasons.  Firstly,
to assure the citizens of Gotham that
everything that can be done over the
Joker killing is being done.
Secondly, because the Batman has
offered to turn himself in-
The crowd REACTS-
HECKLER: So where is he?!
DENT: But first.  Let's consider the
situation: should we give in to this
terrorist's demands?  Do we really
think that-
REPORTER: You'd rather protect an outlaw
vigilante than the lives of
citizens?!
The crowd noisily assents.  Dent calmly motions quiet.
DENT: The Batman is an outlaw...

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel is watching the press conference on TV.
DENT (O.S.): But that's not why we're demanding he
turn himself in.  We're doing it
because we're scared.  We've been
happy to let Batman clean up our
streets for us until now-

INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- CONTINUOUS

HECKLER: Things are worse than ever!
Wayne looks at the Heckler.  At the angry crowd.  Dent leans
over the podium.  Impassioned.
DENT: Yes.  They are.  But the night is
darkest just before the dawn.
71.
(MORE): And I promise you, the dawn is
coming.
(the crowd quiets)
One day, the Batman will have to
answer for the laws he's broken- but
to us, not to this madman.
The crowd seems moved by his words, then, a CHANT-
COP HECKLER: NO MORE DEAD COPS!!
Appreciative noise.
REPORTER: WHERE IS THE BATMAN?
People take up the chant.  Dent has lost them.  He knows it.
DENT: So be it.
(turns to officers)
Take the Batman into custody.
At this, a HUSH DESCENDS.  Wayne is sitting towards the back.
Hungry eyes scan the room.  Wayne starts to rise...  DENT
OFFERS HIS OWN WRISTS TO THE OFFICERS-
DENT: I am the Batman.
A beat.  Wayne stares.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel STARES as Dent is arrested on TV.  Appalled.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY

Rachel comes up to Alfred.  Upset.
RACHEL: Why is he letting Harvey do this,
Alfred?
ALFRED: I don't know.  He went down to the
press conference-
RACHEL: And just stood by?!
ALFRED: Perhaps both Bruce and Mr.Dent
believe that Batman stands for
something more important than a
terrorist's whims, Miss Dawes, even
if everyone hates him for it.
72.
DENT (cont'd)
(MORE): That's the sacrifice he's making- to
not be a hero.  To be something more.
RACHEL: Well, you're right about one thing-
letting Harvey take the fall is not
heroic.
Rachel holds out an ENVELOPE.
RACHEL: You know Bruce best, Alfred...  give
it to him when the time is right.
ALFRED: How will I know?
RACHEL: It's not sealed.
Alfred takes the envelope.  Rachel gives him a kiss.
RACHEL: Goodbye, Alfred.
ALFRED: Goodbye, Rachel.

INT. CELL, MCU -- EVENING

A Detective unlocks the cell and lets Rachel inside.
DENT: I'm sorry, I didn't have time to talk
this through with you.
RACHEL: Don't offer yourself as bait, Harvey.
DENT: They're transferring me to central
holding.  This is the Joker's chance,
and when he attacks, Batman will take
him down.
RACHEL: No.  This is too dangerous-
The Detective knocks.  Dent rises.

EXT. COURTYARD MCU -- EVENING

Detectives stare at Dent as he is led, shackled, to the
waiting CONVOY.  Stephens begins CLAPPING- a handful join in,
but most remain silent.  Rachel follows him to the back of an
armored vehicle.
73.
ALFRED (cont'd)
RACHEL: He's using you as bait- but he
doesn't know if he can get the Joker-
he's failed so far.
DENT: How do you know what he's thinking?
RACHEL: (beat)
I just do, okay?  Harvey, this isn't
just about you, what about all the
people counting on you to turn this
city around?  Tell everyone the truth-
Dent kisses her.  Pulls out his LUCKY COIN-
DENT: Heads I go through with it.
RACHEL: This is your life... you don't leave
something like this to chance...
Dent tosses it at her- Rachel catches it.  Looks.  Heads.
DENT: (sincere)
I'm not.
She turns it over: IT IS DOUBLE-HEADED.  She looks up- the
DOORS CLOSE on his smile.  She shakes her head.  Torn.
RACHEL: You make your own luck.
As SWATS file into the back of the support vehicles-

labels.  Nothing in his pockets but
knives and lint.  No name, no other
alias... nothing.
MAYOR: Go home, Gordon.  The clown'll keep
till morning.  Get some rest- you're
going to need it.  Tomorrow, you take
the big job.
(off look)
You don't have any say in the matter.
(louder, for all)
Commissioner Gordon.
The cops in M.C.U. start CHEERING.

EXT. GORDON HOME -- NIGHT

Gordon rings the bell.  Barbara answers it, dressed in black.
GORDON: I couldn't tell you.  I couldn't risk-
She SLAPS Gordon.  He grabs her, holds her tight as she sobs.

INT. HOLDING, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker's men are processed.  In the harsh light, the men
look a little ridiculous in their clown make-up.  DETECTIVE
MURPHY turns to Stephens.
DETECTIVE MURPHY: Look at these ugly bastards.
One of the men, walks over, clutching at his belly.
FAT THUG: I don't feel good.
DETECTIVE MURPHY: You're a cop killer.  You're lucky to
be feeling anything below the neck.
Alone in his cage, the Joker smiles at this.
83.

INT. KIDS' BEDROOM, GORDON HOME -- NIGHT

Gordon crouches by his son's beside.  He reaches out to touch
James Jr's cheek.  James's eyes open.  Staring at his dad as
if still dreaming.
JAMES: (whispers)
Did Batman save you, dad?
Gordon looks at his son.  A little pride seeps in.
GORDON: Actually, this time I saved him.
Gordon's phone rings-

INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Gordon PUSHES through the swarm of detectives crowded into
the observation room.  The Joker can be seen through the
glass, as well as on a large MONITOR.  Sitting there.  Calm.
GORDON: Has he said anything, yet?
Ramirez shakes her head.  Gordon PUSHES through a door...

INT. INTERROGATION, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker, in near darkness.  Gordon walks in.  Sits.
THE JOKER: Evening, Commissioner.
GORDON: Harvey Dent never made it home.
THE JOKER: Of course not.
GORDON: What have you done with him?
THE JOKER: (laughs)
Me?  I was right here.  Who did you
leave him with?  Your people?
Assuming, of course, that they are
your people not Maroni's...
(off look)
Does it depress you, Lieutenant, to
know how alone you are?
Gordon can't help glancing at the mounted CAMERA.
84.
THE JOKER: Does it make you feel responsible for
Harvey Dent's current predicament?
GORDON: Where is he?
THE JOKER: What time is it?
GORDON: What difference does that make?
THE JOKER: Depending on the time, he might be in
one spot.
(smiles)
Or several.
Gordon stands.  Moves to the Joker.  Undoes his handcuffs.
GORDON: If we're going to play games, I'm
going to need a cup of coffee.
THE JOKER: The good cop, bad cop routine?
Gordon pauses, hand on the doorknob.
GORDON: Not exactly.
Gordon steps out.  The overhead lights COME ON.  BATMAN IS
BEHIND HIM.  The Joker BLINKS in the HARSH WHITE LIGHT.
WHAM!: The Joker's face HITS the table- comes up for air-
CRACK!  CRACK!  To the head.  Batman is in front of him.  The
Joker stares, fascinated.  Bleeding.
THE JOKER: Never start with the head... victim
gets fuzzy.  Can't feel the next-
CRACK!  Batman's fist SMACKS down on the Joker's fingers.
THE JOKER: (calm)
See?
BATMAN: You wanted me.  Here I am.
THE JOKER: I wanted to see what you'd do.  And
you didn't disappoint...
(laughs)
You let five people die.
85.
(MORE): Then you let Dent take your place.
Even to a guy like me... that's cold-
BATMAN: Where's Dent?
THE JOKER: Those mob fools want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.
But I know the truth- there's no
going back.  You've changed things.
Forever.
BATMAN: Then why do you want to kill me?
The Joker starts LAUGHING.  After a moment he's laughing so
hard it sounds like SOBBING.
THE JOKER: Kill you?  I don't want to kill you.
What would I do without you?  Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers?  No
you...
(points)
You.  Complete.  Me.
BATMAN: You're garbage who kills for money.
THE JOKER: Don't talk like one of them- you're
not, even if you'd like to be.  To
them you're a freak like me... they
just need you right now.
He regards Batman with something approaching pity.
THE JOKER: But as soon as they don't, they'll
cast you out like a leper.
The Joker looks into Batman's eyes.  Searching.
THE JOKER: Their morals, their code... it's a
bad joke.  Dropped at the first sign
of trouble.  They're only as good as
the world allows them to be.  You'll
see- I'll show you... when the chips
are down, these civilized people...
they'll eat each other.
(grins)
See, I'm not a monster... I'm just
ahead of the curve.
Batman GRABS the Joker and pulls him upright.
86.
THE JOKER (cont'd)

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

One of the Detectives moves for the door.  Gordon stops him.
GORDON: He's in control.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Batman HOISTS the Joker up by the neck.
BATMAN: Where's Dent?
THE JOKER: You have these rules.  And you think
they'll save you.
BATMAN: I have one rule.
THE JOKER: Then that's the one you'll have to
break.  To know the truth.
BATMAN: Which is?
THE JOKER: (smiles)
The only sensible way to live in this
world is without rules.  Tonight
you're going to break your one
rule...
Batman leans in to the Joker.
BATMAN: I'm considering it.
THE JOKER: There are just minutes left- so,
you'll have to play my little game if
you want to save...
(with relish)
...one of them.
BATMAN: Them?
THE JOKER: For a while I thought you really were
Dent, the way you threw yourself
after her-
Batman DROPS the Joker- RIPS up a bolted-down chair-
87.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Gordon MOVES for the door-

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU -- CONTINUOUS

Batman JAMS the chair under the doorknob- PICKS up the Joker
and HURLS him into the two-way glass.  The glass SPIDERS.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker, bleeding from nose and mouth, LAUGHS at Batman.
THE JOKER: Look at you go... does Harvey know
about you and his-?
The Joker SMASHES into the wall- SLIDES to the floor.  Batman
stands over him, a man possessed-
BATMAN:
WHERE ARE THEY?!: He GRABS the Joker, holding him close-
THE JOKER: Killing is making a choice...
Batman PUNCHES the Joker across the face.  HARD.
BATMAN:
WHERE ARE THEY?!: The Joker FEEDS off Batman's anger.  Loving it.
THE JOKER: ...you choose one life over the
other.  Your friend, the district
attorney.  Or his blushing bride-to-
be.
Batman PUNCHES the Joker again.  The Joker LAUGHS.
THE JOKER: You have nothing.  Nothing to
threaten me with.  Nothing to do with
all your strength...
(spits a tooth)
But don't worry, I'm going to tell
you where they are.  Both of them,
and that's the point- you'll have to
choose.
The Batman stares at the Joker...
THE JOKER: He's at 250 52nd Boulevard.  And
she's on avenue X at Cicero.
88.
Batman DROPS him.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Batman RACES past Gordon.
GORDON: Which one are you-
BATMAN: Dent knew the risks.

EXT. GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Gordon and his men SCRAMBLE into their cars...

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Black.
RACHEL: Can anyone hear me?
Harvey Dent opens his eyes.  He's bound to a chair in a
dingy, unfurnished basement apartment.
DENT: Rachel?  Rachel is that you?
RACHEL: (sobbing)
Harvey.  You're OK.  I thought...
Her voice is coming from a speakerphone on the floor.
DENT: It's OK, Rachel.  Everything's going
to be just fine.
He looks around.  Behind him, metal BARRELS, hooked up to a
car battery, with a TIMER counting down: five minutes.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker sits, smiling, content.  Stephens guards the door.
THE JOKER: I want my phone call.
89.
STEPHENS: That's nice.
THE JOKER: How many of your friends have I
killed?
STEPHENS: I'm a twenty year man.  I can tell
the difference between punks who need
a little lesson in manners, and the
freaks like you who would just enjoy
it.
(quiet)
And you killed six of my friends.

INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Fat Thug shuffles to the bars, where a COP stands guard.
FAT THUG: (agony)
Please.  My insides hurt.
COP: Step away from the bars.
FAT THUG: The boss said he would make the
voices go away.  He said he would go
inside and replace them with bright
lights.  Like Christmas.
COP: That's great.  Please step-
The Fat Thug COLLAPSES.  The Cop grabs his radio.

INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

Rachel is bound to a chair.  Behind her are barrels identical
to the ones behind Dent.
DENT: Can you move your chair?
RACHEL: No.  Harvey, we don't have much time-
The timer connected to the bomb reads 2.47... 2.46...

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Dent DRAGS his chair, inching closer to the barrels.
DENT: Look for something to free yourself.
90.
The chair JAMS against a ridge in the floor.  Dent STRAINS to
reach the timer.  Inches shy.
RACHEL: They said only one of us was going to
make it.  That they'd let our...
(pause)
Our friends choose...
Dent strains...  THE CHAIR, AND DENT, TOPPLE OVER- KNOCKING
OVER A BARREL.:
RACHEL: Harvey?  What's happening?
Dent, one side of his face pressed against the bare floor,
watches the open barrel SPEW DIESEL FUEL around him-
DENT: Nothing.  I'm trying to...
Dent contorts his head to keep from swallowing any.

EXT. STREETS, GOTHAM -- NIGHT

The bat-pod SKIDS SIDEWAYS, WHEELS FLIPPING as the gyro keeps
Batman upright on the tumbling bike- it comes to rest- guns
lined up with a fire exit- BLOWS the door off its hinges-
JUMPS off the bike-

EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT

Gridlock.  Gordon SWERVES onto the sidewalk.  People SCATTER.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker sits like a kid kept after class.  He smiles.
THE JOKER: You know why I use a knife,
Detective?  Guns are too quick.  You
don't get to savor all the little
emotions.  See, in their last
moments, people show you who they
really are...
Stephens tries hard to ignore him.  It isn't working.
THE JOKER: So, in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.
(smiles)
Would you like to know which of them
were really cowards?
91.
STEPHENS: (rolls up sleeves)
I know you're going to enjoy this.
But I'm going to enjoy it more.
Stephens PUNCHES the Joker in the gut.

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Dent is half submerged in diesel fuel.
RACHEL: Harvey, in case... I want you to know
something...
Dent CHOKES, his emotions overwhelming him.
DENT: Don't think like that, Rachel.
They're coming for you.
RACHEL: I know, but I don't want them to...

INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

Rachel looks at the timer.  Ten seconds left.
RACHEL: I don't want to live without you.
Because I do have an answer, and my
answer is yes...

INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

A MEDIC CUTS away the Fat Thug's shirt- his belly has large
INCISION, which has been closed with crude looking STITCHES-
MEDIC: He's got some kind of... contusion...
A RECTANGULAR SHAPE is visible under the skin above his
navel.

INT. DETECTIVE'S ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

Stephens shuffles out into the room, a piece of BROKEN GLASS
held to his THROAT by the Joker.  Cops draw their weapons.
STEPHENS: This is my own damn fault.  Just
shoot him.
DETECTIVE MURPHY: What do you want?
THE JOKER: I want my phone call.
92.
The Detectives look at each other.  One of them pulls out his
cell phone.  TOSSES it to the Joker, who begins to dial.

INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Medic gingerly PRESSES the rectangle.  It illuminates, a
soft blue light visible through the skin.
COP: Is that a... phone?

INT. DETECTIVE'S ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT

The Joker presses SEND.  At the end of the room, the door to
the holding area EXPLODES-

INT. HALLWAY, TENEMENT -- NIGHT

Batman SPRINTS down the hall- stops at a door- KICKS it-

EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT

Cars PULL UP- Gordon gets out, carrying a fire ax-

INT. HALLWAY, TENEMENT -- NIGHT

Batman KICKS- the door gives- Batman SMASHES it open-

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

...Batman BURSTS through the door- Dent looks up in horror-
DENT: NO!  Not me... Why did you come for
me?!
Batman STARES at Dent.  The Joker lied.  The counter hits 5
seconds.  Batman DRAGS Dent out- Dent FIGHTS to stay-
DENT:
RACHEL!:
RACHEL: Harvey?  Harvey, it's okay...
DENT:
RACHEL!!!:

EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT

The BLAST HURLS Gordon backward onto the hood of his car- THE

INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Batman wraps his cape around Dent and hurls them both through
the door.  Dent is SCREAMING-

heads for it anyway.  Five of his men have to RESTRAIN HIM.

EXT. ALLEYWAY, GOTHAM -- NIGHT

A SECOND EXPLOSION- Batman COVERS Dent as the FIREBALL HITS
them- IGNITING the diesel soaking Dent's left side- he starts
BURNING.  And stops screaming.  Batman ROLLS Dent on the wet
pavement...  Dent SIZZLES.  Silent.

EXT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS

Dent is wheeled into an ambulance, bandages held to his face.
His one visible eye STARES BLANKLY, oblivious to the panic-

EXT. 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon watches the fire.  DEBRIS blows across the asphalt.
Gordon picks up two pieces: SINGED JOKER CARDS.  In place of
the Joker's face is a PHOTO OF LAU.
A POLICE SERGEANT: approaches.
SERGEANT: Dent's alive, Jim.  Just.  But back
at M.C.U.... the Joker's gone...
GORDON: With Lau?
(the Cop nods)
The Joker planned to be caught.  He
wanted me to lock him up in M.C.U..
94.

EXT. STREET, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- DAWN

A squad car BLAZES down the street.  The Joker sticks his
head out the window like a dog, feeling the wind...

INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN

Alfred sits at a table reading the letter from Rachel.
RACHEL (V.O.): Dear Bruce, I need to explain...

EXT. 52ND STREET -- DAWN

Water.  Smoldering blackness.  The FIRE CREWS extinguish the
last flames of the devastated building.  A FIREMAN nudges his
COLLEAGUE, pointing out something in the devastation...
RACHEL (V.O.): ...I need to be honest and clear.
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent...

INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT -- DAWN

Glimpses of Dent's damaged face as SURGEONS surround him.
RACHEL (V.O.): I love him, I want to spend the rest
of my life with him...

EXT. 52ND STREET -- DAWN

The Firemen watch a statue-like figure amidst the charred
ruins.  The Batman.
RACHEL (V.O.): When I told you that if Gotham no
longer needed Batman we could be
together, I meant it...

INT. MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY

Gordon surveys the wreckage of MCU.  The bodies.
RACHEL (V.O.): But I'm not sure the day will come...

EXT. 52ND STREET -- DAWN

Batman bends to the ground on one knee, his black glove
spread against the smoldering debris.
RACHEL (V.O.): ...when you no longer need Batman.  I
hope it does, and if it does I will
be there...
95.
He spots something.  DENT'S TWO-HEADED COIN.  Blackened,
SCARRED.  Batman turns it over.  The other side is PRISTINE.

keep your faith in people...
BATMAN: I'm sorry, Harvey.
Batman puts DENT'S DAMAGED COIN on the bedside table.

INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

RACHEL (V.O.): Love, now and always, Rachel.
Alfred finishes the letter.  Tears in his eyes, he folds it
back into its envelope.  Places it on the breakfast tray.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN

Alfred moves through the silent space, stepping past the cowl
and gauntlets lying on the cold marble.  He approaches Wayne,
half-undressed, slumped in a chair watching Gotham.
ALFRED: I prepared a little breakfast.
Nothing.  Alfred sets down the tray.  The envelope is propped
against the silver teapot.
ALFRED: Very well.
WAYNE: Alfred?
ALFRED: Yes, Master Wayne?
Wayne turns, a desperate look in his eye.
96.
WAYNE: Did I bring this on us?  On her?  I
thought I would inspire good, not
madness-
ALFRED: You have inspired good.  But you spat
in the face of Gotham's criminals-
didn't you think there might be
casualties?  Things were always going
to have to get worse before they got
better.
WAYNE: But Rachel, Alfred...
ALFRED: Rachel believed in what you stood
for.  What we stand for.
Wayne looks up at Alfred.  Alfred picks up the cowl.
ALFRED: Gotham needs you.
WAYNE: Gotham needs its hero.  And I let the
Joker blow him half to hell-
ALFRED: Which is why for now, they'll have to
make do with you.
Alfred hands him the cowl.  Wayne looks at him.
WAYNE: She was going to wait for me.  Dent
doesn't know.  He can never know...
Alfred glances at the envelope.  Takes it off the tray.
WAYNE: What's that?
ALFRED: It can wait.
Alfred puts the envelope in his pocket.
WAYNE: That bandit, in the forest in
Burma...  Did you catch him?
(Alfred nods)
How?
ALFRED: (uneasy)
We burned the forest down.
97.

EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- DAY

A national guard helicopter ROARS over Gotham General.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

Dent.  Bandaged.  Sedated.  Coming up for air.  Sees
something on the table: his coin.  He fumbles for it,
marvelling at its shiny face.  Remembering.
INSERT CUT: RACHEL CATCHES THE COIN.
Dent turns the coin over.  The other side is devastated.  He
STARES at the scarred face.  Starts ripping his bandages.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY

Alfred comes up to Wayne.  Points him to the TV.
ALFRED: You need to see this.
On screen: Engel, in his studio, addresses the camera.
ENGEL: ...he's a credible source- an A and M
lawyer for a prestigious consultancy.
He says he's waited as long as he can
for the Batman to do the right
thing...
The shot cuts to REESE, nodding.
ENGEL: Now he's taking matters into his own
hands.  We'll be live at five with
the true identity of the Batman, stay
with us...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon ENTERS.  Dent STARES to one side.  He looks normal.
GORDON: I'm sorry about Rachel.
(nothing)
The Doctor says you're in agonizing
pain but you won't accept medication.
That you're refusing skin grafts-
DENT: Remember the name you all had for me
when I was at Internal Affairs?  What
was it, Gordon?
GORDON: Harvey, I can't-
98.
DENT:
SAY IT!: Dent's anger makes Gordon flinch.  He looks away.  Ashamed.
GORDON: (small)
Two-face.  Harvey two-face.
Dent turns to face Gordon- the left side of Dent's face is
DESTROYED- skin blackened and shriveled.  Molars visible.
The eye a ball and socket.  Dent manages a small smile with
the good side of his face.
DENT: Why should I hide who I am?
GORDON: I... I know you tried to warn me.
I'm sorry.  Wuertz picked you up- was
he working for them?
(nothing)
Do you know who picked up Rachel?
(nothing)
Harvey, I need to know which of my
men I can trust.
Dent looks at Gordon.  Cold.
DENT: Why would you listen to me now?
GORDON: I'm sorry, Harvey.
DENT: No.  No you're not.  Not yet.
Gordon takes a last look at Dent.  Then leaves.

INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon steps out.  Someone is there.  Maroni.  On crutches.
Gordon stares at him.  Cold.  Maroni shifts, awkward.
MARONI: This craziness.  This is too much.

before you let the clown out of the
box.
MARONI: You want him, I can tell you where
he'll be this afternoon.
99.

INT. RUSTED HULK -- CONTINUOUS

They pass into a huge hold.  In the middle: A BILLION
DOLLARS.  The pile is thirty feet high.  Standing on top- the
Joker.  At his feet, bound, is Lau.
The Chechen laughs.
CHECHEN: Like I say- not so crazy as you look.
The Joker jumps from the top, slides down the pile.
THE JOKER: I told you- I'm a man of my word.
(looks around)
Where's the Italian?
The Chechen shrugs.  Pulls out a cigar.  Lights it.
CHECHEN: More for us.  What you do with all
your money, Mr.Joker?
The Joker GRABS a can of GASOLINE from his thug.
THE JOKER: I'm a man of simple tastes.  I like
gunpowder.  Dynamite...
He is SPLASHING gasoline onto the money.
THE JOKER: ...gasoline...
The Chechen, FURIOUS, steps forwards.  The Joker turns.  JABS
his gun in the Chechen's face.  The Chechen's bodyguards
REACT.  The Joker's men DRAW on them.
THE JOKER: And you know what they have in
common?  They're cheap.
CHECHEN: You said you were a man of your word.
The Joker PLUCKS the cigar from the Chechen's lips.
THE JOKER: I am.
The Joker tosses the cigar at the pile.
THE JOKER: I'm only burning my half.
100.
The Chechen watches the money catch fire.
THE JOKER: All you care about is money.  This
city deserves a better class of
criminal, and I'm going to give it to
them.  This is my town now.  Tell
your men they work for me.
The Joker crouches down to the Chechen's dogs.  They GROWL.
CHECHEN: They won't work for a freak.
The Joker takes out a knife.  Tosses it to his man.
THE JOKER: Cut him up and offer him to his
little Princes.  Let's show him just
how loyal a hungry dog is.
The Joker's men GRAB the Chechen.
THE JOKER: It's not about money.  It's about
sending a message...
The Joker watches the towering FLAMES.  Lau screams.
THE JOKER: Everything.  Burns.
The Joker pulls out a phone...

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO -- DAY

Reese has a confident air.  Engel is taking calls.
CALLER 1 (O.S.): I wanna how much they're gonna pay
you to say who Batman really is.
REESE: That's simply not why I'm doing this.
ENGEL: Caller, you're on the air.
CALLER 2 (O.S.): Harvey dent didn't want us to give in
to this maniac- you think you know
better than him?
ENGEL: Guy's got a point- Dent didn't want
Batman to give himself up, is this
the right thing to do?
101.
REESE: If we could talk to Dent now he might
feel differently-
ENGEL: And we wish him a speedy recovery.
God knows we need him, now.  Let's
take another call-
OLD LADY (O.S.): Mr.Reese, what's more valuable: one
life, or a hundred?
REESE: I guess it would depend on the life.
OLD LADY (O.S.): OK.  Let's say it's your life.  Is it
worth more than the lives of several
hundred others?
REESE: Of course not.
OLD LADY (O.S.): I'm glad you feel that way.  Because
I've put a bomb in one of the city's
hospitals.  It's going off in sixty
minutes unless someone kills you.
ENGEL: Who is this?
OLD  (O.S.): Just a concerned citizen-
(drops pitch to the
JOKER'S VOICE): -and regular guy...

INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon and his men are gearing up to take down the Joker.  A
Detective turns up the TV in the bullpen-
THE JOKER (O.S.): I had a vision.  Of a world without
Batman.  The mob ground out a little
profit and the police tried to shut
them down, one block at a time...
and it was so... boring.  I've had a
change of heart.  I don't want
Mr.Reese spoiling everything, but why
should I have all the fun?  Let's
give someone else a chance...
Reese looks around, twitching.  Sweating.
102.
THE JOKER (O.S.): If Coleman Reese isn't dead in sixty
minutes, then I blow up a hospital.
Of course, you could always kill
yourself, Mr.Reese.
But that would
be the noble thing to do.  And you're
a lawyer.
The line rings off.  Engel is speechless.
Gordon turns to the uniform COPS.
GORDON: Call in every officer- tell them to
head to their nearest hospital and
start evac and search.  Call the
transit authority, school board,
prisons- get every available bus down
to a hospital- the priority is Gotham
General- wheel everybody out of that
place right now- my hunch is that's
where the bomb is.
DETECTIVE MURPHY: Why?
GORDON: That's where Harvey Dent is.
The Uniforms SPRINT off.  Gordon turns to his Detectives.
UNIFORMED COP: Where are we going, sir?
On screen: Reese is a deer in the headlights.
GORDON: To get Reese.

INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY

Wayne and Alfred move to the elevator.
WAYNE: I need you plugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their families.

WAYNE: Hospital admissions.
ALFRED: Will you be taking the batpod, sir?

WAYNE: In the middle of the day?  Not very
subtle, Alfred.
ALFRED: The Lamborghini then.
(watches Wayne go)
Much more subtle.

Wayne's Lamborghini TEARS through downtown.

INT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

CHAOS.  PATIENTS and STAFF running around.  COPS and TRAFFIC

outside Dent's room, look around, unsure-
NURSE: Sir, are you going to help?!
Two Cops move to help wheel gurneys around the corner.

INT. LOBBY, TELEVISION STUDIO -- DAY

Gordon and his men escort Reese out of the elevator- Engel
follows with a camera crew.  As they approach the glass doors
Gordon looks out at an angry crowd.
ENGEL: Commissioner?!  You really think
someone would try to-
Gordon SPOTS an OLD MAN raising a PISTOL- Gordon THROWS Reese
to the ground as SHOTS SHATTER the laminated glass of the
lobby.  The Crowd SURGES in all directions-
GORDON: Get the cars around back!
Gordon hauls Reese to the stairwell.

REESE: (shaken)
They're trying to kill me.

INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon throws Reese in the back.  Smiles.
GORDON: Well, maybe Batman will save you.
The van PEELS out.  Heads onto the streets.

EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

Cops load patients onto BUSES.  A TV van pulls up, Engel and
his Cameraman jump out.  One of Dent's guards, POLK, looks
into a SCHOOL BUS.  Turns to the Cop loading it.
POLK: Okay, don't put anyone else on.
(gets on radio)
Davis, I got space, bring him out.
(no answer)
Davis?
Polk heads back towards the hospital, against the flow.

INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne trails the police van from a distance.
WAYNE: I saw Burns and Zachary... and a
patrolman I don't know.
ALFRED: Burns is clean... Zachary...
WAYNE: There's at least one I don't know-
send the information to Gordon-

INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

WITH RELATIVES IN GOTHAM HOSPITALS- BURKE, RAMIREZ, TILL...

INT. DENT'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Polk enters the room.  No Davis.  Just a REDHEADED NURSE,
back towards him, reading Dent's chart.
105.
POLK: Ma'am, we're going to have to move
him, now.
(nothing)
Ma'am?
The Redhead TURNS- it is the Joker, silenced pistol in hand.
He FIRES.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

The Lamborghini zips around a car to get closer to the van.

INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon is reading his phone: ERIKSON, BERG.  Gordon looks up
sharply.  Considers the uniformed cop nervously fingering his
shotgun.
GORDON: Berg, isn't it?
The young cop, BERG, looks up.  Sweating.
BERG: Commissioner?
GORDON: You okay, son?
Berg nods.  Looks at his watch.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

The Joker draws closer to Dent's bed.  Dent STRAINS at the
leather cuffs binding him to the bed.
THE JOKER: I don't want there to be any hard
feelings between us, Harvey.
The Joker loosens Dent's restraints.
THE JOKER: When you and Rachel were being
abducted I was sitting in Gordon's
cage.  I didn't rig those charges-
DENT: Your men.  Your plan.
THE JOKER: Do I really look like a guy with a
plan, Harvey?  I don't have a
plan...The mob has plans, the cops
have plans.  You know what I am,
Harvey?
106.
Dent's hand is TREMBLING.
THE JOKER: I'm a dog chasing cars... I wouldn't
know what to do with one if I caught
it.  I just do things.  I'm just the
wrench in the gears.  I hate plans.
Yours, theirs, everyone's.  Maroni
has plans.  Gordon has plans.
Schemers trying to control their
worlds.  I'm not a schemer, I show
the schemers how pathetic their
attempts to control things really
are.  So when I say that you and your
girlfriend was nothing personal, you
know I'm telling the truth...
Hands him the pistol.  Dent holds it to the Joker's head.

EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne ROARS past a line of traffic to settle in a few cars
back from the police van, sitting at a red light.

INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne studies the intersection- spots a PICKUP jostling for
position on the cross street.

INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon watches Berg, mentally tracing the trajectory of his
shotgun barrel as Berg fiddles with his gun.  Gordon starts
trying to subtly unholster his own weapon.
GORDON: I'm gonna need your weapon, son.
Berg looks at Gordon.
BERG: What?

INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne watches the driver of the pickup staring intently at
the police van.  Lining it up.

INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Reese looks from Berg to Gordon.  Berg looks at Gordon,
trembling, the barrel of his gun inching lower in the car.
BERG: Why?  Because my wife's in hospital?
GORDON: Yeah.  That would be why.
107.

INT. DENT'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

The Joker leans in, pressing his head to the gun's barrel.
THE JOKER: It's the schemers who put you where
you are.  You were a schemer.  You
had plans.  Look where it got you.  I
just did what I do best- I took your
plan, and I turned it on itself.
Look what I've done to this city with
a few drums of gas and a couple of
bullets.  Nobody panics when the
expected people get killed.  Nobody
panics when things go according to
plan, even if the plan is horrifying.
If I tell the press that tomorrow a
gangbanger will get shot, or a
truckload of soldiers will be blown
up, nobody panics.  Because it's all
part of the plan.  But when I say
that one little old mayor will die,
everybody loses their minds!
Introduce a little anarchy, you upset
the established order and everything
becomes chaos.  I'm an agent of
chaos.  And you know the thing about
chaos, Harvey?
Dent looks into the Joker's eyes.  Finding meaning.
THE JOKER: It's fair.
Dent looks down at the coin in his hands.  Turns it over,
feels it's comforting weight.  Shows the Joker the good side.
DENT: You live.
He turns the coin over.  The flip side is deeply SCARRED.
DENT: You die.
The Joker looks at the coin.  Looks at Dent, admiringly.
THE JOKER: Now you're talking.
Dent FLICKS the coin into the air.  Catches it.  Looks.

EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

The light turns GREEN.  The police van pulls into the

108.

INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS

Berg licks his lips, nervous.
BERG: Mr.Reese?

EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

The pickup BARRELS at the van, FULL TILT- at the last second
Wayne's Lamborghini SLIPS alongside the van- the pickup
SMASHES INTO THE LAMBORGHINI-

INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

As the van JOLTS with the impact Gordon LEAPS forward,
PUSHING UP Berg's shotgun barrel, which FIRES into the roof-
Gordon SMASHES Berg on the head with his sidearm.

EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon's men pull the pickup driver from his cab- Gordon
crouches down to the Lamborghini wreck to help pull Wayne
from the car.  Gordon recognizes him as he pulls him free.
GORDON: You okay, Mr.Wayne?
Wayne looks at him, woozy.  Sits on the curb.
WAYNE: Call me Bruce.  I think so.
GORDON: That was a brave thing, you did.
WAYNE: Trying to catch the light?
GORDON: You weren't protecting the van?
Wayne turns- sees the police van as if for the first time.
Reese steps down, dazed.
WAYNE: Why?  Who's in it?
Reese locks eyes with Wayne.  Nods.  Gordon sizes up Bruce
Wayne and his crushed sports car.
GORDON: You don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr.Wayne?
109.
WAYNE: (shrugs)
It can get a little intense.  Think I
should go to hospital?
GORDON: Not today, I wouldn't.

INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

The Joker walks calmly through the mostly deserted building.
As he walks he pulls a DETONATOR from his pocket.  Strolling
along he PUSHES THE BUTTON... STAGGERED EXPLOSIONS BURST INTO
THE CORRIDOR BEHIND HIM LIKE DEMOLITION BLASTS... the Joker
just walks out the door...

EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

The Joker STROLLS down the steps- WINDOWS BLOW OUT IN SERIES-
People DIVE for cover- Engel PILES into a school bus-
The Joker walks across the parking lot- THE BUILDING
COLLAPSING BEHIND HIM...:

EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon hears the EXPLOSION.
GORDON: Gotham general...
(grabs his phone)

INT. BAR, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- DAY

An empty neighborhood dive, the local DRUNK passed out at the
bar, BARTENDER, watching BREAKING NEWS on the TV.
BARTENDER: Sweet Jesus.  D'you see this, Mike?
They blew up a hospital...
110.
Detective Wuertz, at a booth looks up at the TV, bored.
BARTENDER: Shouldn't you be out there, you know,
doing something?
WUERTZ: It's my day off.
The Bartender shuts the register.
BARTENDER: I gotta take a leak, keep an eye on
things, will ya?
The Bartender steps out.  The back door OPENS again.
WUERTZ: What?  You need me to shake it for-
He TRAILS off as someone sticks a gun in his face: Harvey
Dent.  Standing in shadow.  He sits.
DENT: Hello.
WUERTZ: Dent, I thought you was...dead...
Dent leans into the light.  The left side of his face is
HIDEOUSLY BURNED, cheek gone, blackened teeth and gums.
DENT: Half.
Dent picks up Wuertz's drink.  Takes a SIP.  Wuertz watches
the bare muscles RETRACT as Dent SWALLOWS.
DENT: Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?
WUERTZ: It must've been Maroni's men-
Dent SLAMS the glass back on the table- Wuertz FLINCHES.
DENT: You, of all people, are gonna protect
the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
WUERTZ: I don't know- he'd never tell me.
(stares at Dent)
I swear to God, I didn't know what
they were gonna do to you-
111.
DENT: Funny, I don't know what's going to
happen to you, either.
Dent pulls his coin from his pocket.  FLIPS it.  Wuertz
watches it SPIN.  It lands on the table.  Scarred side up.
The drunk at the bar STIRS at the GUNSHOT.

EXT. GOTHAM GENERAL -- DAY

Gordon, manic, surveys the scene with a Cop-
GORDON: You must know how many were inside-
you've got patient lists, roll calls-
COP: Sir!  Sir.  Take a look at what we're
dealing with.  Cops, National Guard-
(gestures at buses)
We're showing 50 missing- but that
building was clear.  These buses are
heading off to other hospitals- my
guess is we missed one.
GORDON: Yeah?  What's your guess about where
Harvey Dent is?
The cop says nothing.
GORDON: Keep looking.  Keep it to yourself.

INT. FOX'S OFFICE WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- DAY

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY

Fox watches two security men force the door.  He enters
alone.

INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY

Fox enters the dimly-lit room.  At one end is an
extraordinary array of thousands of tiny monitors.  Fox
approaches, fascinated, as they quietly display architectural
patterns individually and in concert.  The images become a
MAP.:
BATMAN: Beautiful.  Isn't it?
112.
Fox nods, staring at the monitors as Batman approaches.
FOX: Beautiful.  Unethical.  Dangerous.
You've turned every phone in the city
into a microphone...
Lucius presses a key.  The BABBLE of a MILLION CONVERSATIONS
at once fills the room.  Every cell phone in the city.
BATMAN: And high frequency
generator/receiver.
FOX: Like the phone I gave you in Hong
Kong.  You took my sonar concept and
applied it to everybody's phone in
the City.  With half the city feeding
you sonar you can image all of
Gotham.
(turns to Batman)
This is wrong.
BATMAN: I've got to find this man, Lucius.
FOX: But at what cost?
BATMAN: The database is null-key encrypted.
It can only be accessed by one
person.
FOX: No one should have that kind of
power.
WAYNE: That's why I gave it to you.  Only
you can use it.
Lucius looks at Batman.  Hard.
FOX: Spying on thirty million people
wasn't in my job description.
Batman points to a TV screen.  Fox turns.  ON SCREEN: the
Joker shakes his head above a graphic "LATEST THREAT"...
THE JOKER: What does it take to make you people
want to join in..?
113.

EXT. SITUATION TENT AT GOTHAM GENERAL -- CONTINUOUS

the game.  So, here it is...

INT. BAR, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS

The bar, packed with business people watches the TV.  SILENT.
THE JOKER: Come nightfall, this city is mine,
and anyone left here plays by my
rules.  If you don't want to be in
the game, get out now.
Bar patrons start moving... The Joker reaches for the camera-
THE JOKER: But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are
in for a surprise.
CUT TO STATIC. The bar patrons look around, confused.

INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Fox turns from the TV to look at Batman.
BATMAN: Trust me.
Fox stares at Batman.
BATMAN: This is the audio sample.
He plugs a USB dongle into the console.  A sample of the
Joker's voice from the call-in news program plays.
BATMAN: If he talks within range of any phone
in the city, you'll be able to
triangulate his position.
Lucius toggles a menu.  The city is an open book- People
working, eating, sleeping.  Lucius shakes his head.
BATMAN: When you've finished, type your name
to switch it off.
FOX: I'll help you this one time...
Lucius sits at the console.  Batman moves off-
114.
FOX: But consider this my resignation.
Batman turns.  Fox looks at him, serious.
FOX: As long as this machine is at Wayne
Industries, I won't be.

EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- DUSK

Gothamites POUR out of the city, on foot and by car...  the
BRIDGES and TUNNELS are deserted, but for BOMB SQUAD search
teams.

INT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon briefs the Mayor.
GORDON: My officers are going over every inch
of the tunnels and bridges, but with
the Joker's threat they're not and
option.
MAYOR: Land routes East?
GORDON: Backed up for hours.  Which leaves
the ferries with thirty thousand
waiting to board.  Plus, corrections
are at capacity, so I want to use a
ferry to take some prisoners off the
island.
MAYOR: The men you and Dent put away?  Those
aren't people I'm worried about.
GORDON: You should be- they're the people you
least want to be stuck with in an
emergency.  Whatever the Joker's
planning, it's a good bet that
Harvey's prisoners might be involved.
I want 'em out of here.

EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- DUSK

At the ferry terminal, National Guardsman watch over the
THIRTY THOUSAND jostling, scared people waiting to board the
two MASSIVE FERRIES to Seven Sisters.  Grumbles turn to YELLS
as 800 PRISONERS are loaded onto a ferry by shotgun-toting
CORRECTIONS OFFICERS.: 115.
CIVILIAN: That ain't right!  We should be on
that boat.
NATIONAL GUARDSMAN: You want to ride across with them, be
my guest.

INT. LIMO -- DUSK

Maroni settles back into his seat.  The car pulls away.
MARONI: Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.
DENT: Going to join your wife?
Maroni STARTS.  Someone is in here with him.  Harvey Dent-
Two Face- leans forward, clutching a pistol.
DENT: You love her?
MARONI: Yes.
DENT: Can you imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?
MARONI: Take it up with the Joker.  He killed
your woman.  Made you... like this...
DENT: The Joker's just a mad dog.  I want
whoever let him off the leash.
Maroni looks at Dent.  Worried.
DENT: I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?
Who picked up Rachel?  It must've
been someone she trusted.
MARONI: If I tell you, will you let me go?
DENT: It can't hurt your chances.
116.
MARONI: It was Ramirez.
Pulls out his coin.  Dent cocks the pistol...
MARONI: But you said-
DENT: I said it couldn't hurt your chances.
Dent FLIPS it.  Looks: good side.  He shrugs.
DENT: Lucky guy.
Maroni looks confused.  Dent FLIPS the coin again.  Looks
down at the coin.  Shakes his head.
DENT: But he's not.
MARONI: Who?
Dent smiles.  PUTS HIS SEAT BELT ON.
DENT: Your driver.
Dent presses the barrel of the revolver behind the shadow of
the driver.  Maroni LUNGES, SCREAMING.  Dent FIRES.

lights of the distant shore of the mainland.

INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The FIRST MATE looks out the window, at the second ferry.  It
is DEAD in the WATER.  He turns to the PILOT [PRISON FERRY].
FIRST MATE: They've lost their engines.
117.
PILOT [PRISON FERRY]: Get on the radio and tell 'em we'll
come back for them once we dump these
scumbags-
Suddenly, the control panel FLICKERS and DIES.

PRESENT, topped with a BOW.

INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Pilot [Prison Ferry] is holding the small present.  His
radio CRACKLES.

Same thing over here- enough diesel

EXT. ELEVATED ROADWAY, DOWTOWN GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

Batman sits on the bat-pod, cape blowing.  Listening.
BATMAN: Fox?  There's something going on on
the ferries...

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT

As cold scared Families watch, the NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
UNWRAPS that ferry's present.  Inside, he finds a crude
REMOTE DETONATOR.:
NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER: Why would they give us the detonator
to our own bomb?
Up in the wiring at the ceiling, a CELL PHONE taped in to the
P.A. rings and answers.
THE JOKER (O.S.): Tonight, you're all going to be part
of a social experiment.
ON BOTH FERRIES: CIVILIANS, PRISONERS, CREW, AND NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN ALL LISTEN AS THE JOKER'S VOICE RINGS OUT.
118.

INT. LAB, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- NIGHT

Lucius Fox looks up as the console CHIMES.
FOX: I'm zeroing in.
THE JOKER (O.S.): Through the magic of diesel fuel and
ammonium nitrate, I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky high.  Anyone
attempts to get off their boat, you
all die...
FOX: His voice is on the ferry, but that's
not the source...

EXT. ROOFTOPS ABOVE GOTHAM -- NIGHT

Batman looks out, across the entire city skyline.
BATMAN: Do you have a location on the Joker?
FOX: It's west...
Batman FIRES UP the bat-pod- his cape SHRINKS into its pack
form as he PEELS OUT, ROARING into the night.
THE JOKER (O.S.): But we're going to make things a
little more interesting than that.
Tonight, we're going to learn a
little bit about ourselves...

INT. GORDON HOME -- CONTINUOUS

Barbara Gordon answers the phone.
RAMIREZ (O.S.): Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez-

Jim needs you to pack up and get the
kids in the car right away.
BARBARA: But the units outside-
119.
RAMIREZ (O.S.): Barbara, those cops can't be trusted.
Jim needs you away from them as soon
as possible.  I'll call them off for
10 minutes, you'll have to move fast-
BARBARA: But where-
RAMIREZ (O.S.): I'm going to give you an address- Jim
will meet you there...

EXT. MCU -- CONTINUOUS

Ramirez is holding the phone.
RAMIREZ: 250, 52nd street.  Leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out.
Dent is holding a gun at Ramirez's head.  She hangs up.
DENT: She believe you?
Ramirez nods.
DENT: She trusts you.  Just like Rachel
did.
RAMIREZ: I didn't know-
DENT: 'What they were gonna do'?  You're
the second cop to say that to me.
What, exactly, did you think they
were going to do?
RAMIREZ: I'm sorry- they got me early on.  My
mother's medical bills and my-
DENT: Don't!
Dent FLIPS his coin.
RAMIREZ: I took a little from them- once
they've got you, they keep you.  I'm
sorry.
Dent looks at his coin.  Good side.
120.
DENT: Live to fight another day, officer.
Dent CRACKS her on the head with his gun.

INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Pilot [Prison Ferry] tries the radio.  It's DEAD.
PILOT [PRISON FERRY]: He killed the radio.
THE JOKER (O.S.): There's no need for all of you to
die.  That would be a waste.  So I've
left you both a little present.

EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT

The Joker stares out over the harbor, at the ferries.
Talking into a cell phone.  Holding a detonator, with TWO
BUTTONS.:
THE JOKER: Each of you has a remote to blow up
the other boat.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Prisoners and Corrections Officers listen.  Appalled.
THE JOKER (O.S.): At midnight, I blow you all up.  If,
however, one of you presses the
button, I'll let that boat live.  You
choose.  So who's it going to be-
Harvey Dent's most wanted scumbag
collection... or the sweet innocent
civilians?
(beat)
Oh, and you might want to decide
quickly, because the people on the
other boat may not be quite so noble.
The Joker HANGS UP.  The Pilot [Prisoner Ferry] looks down at
the remote in his hands.  Prisoners begin YELLING and
PUSHING.  The WARDEN takes the remote from the Pilot- COCKS
his shotgun.  His men level their weapons at the crowd.

passengers take a step towards him.  He PULLS his weapon.
NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER: Stay back.
A BUSINESSMAN clutching his briefcase speaks up.
BUSINESSMAN: Who are you to decide?  We ought to
talk it over, at least.
Other passengers agree.  A MOTHER with two KIDS speaks up.
MOTHER: We don't all have to die.  Why should
my babies die?  Those men had their
chance-
NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER: We're not talking about this...
PASSENGER 1: They're talking over the same exact
thing on the other boat.
PASSENGER 2: If they're even bothering to talk.
Let's put it to a vote.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

CHITS into it.  Passengers filling out chits eye each other.
People on their phones say goodbye to loved ones.

SWAT: We've found our missing bus.

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon looks at the SWAT LEADER.
GORDON: Then we have a hostage situation.
They look across at the large windows of the Prewitt
Building.  The Joker's men, in crude, homemade CLOWN MASKS
are clearly visible, automatic weapons in hand.
SWAT SNIPER: I got hostages!
They look through his scope.  Crouched deeper in the room,
PATIENTS, DOCTORS, and NURSES, huddled.
GORDON: It's a shooting gallery.  Why'd he
choose a spot with such big windows?
BATMAN: He likes the view.
Batman gestures towards the view of the ferries.
SWAT LEADER: We have clear shots on five clowns.
Snipers take them out, smash the
windows- a team rappels in, a team
moves in by the stairwells.  2 or 3
or three casualties, max.
GORDON: (barely hesitates)
Let's do it.
BATMAN: It's not that simple.  With the
Joker, it never is.
GORDON: What's simple, is that every second
we don't take him, those people on
the ferries get closer to blowing
each other up!
123.
BATMAN: That won't happen.
GORDON: Then he'll blow them both up!
There's no time- we have to go in now-
BATMAN: There's always a catch with him-
GORDON: That's why we can't wait- we can't
play his games-
Batman turns.
BATMAN: I need five minutes.  Alone-
GORDON: No.  There's no time.  We have clear
shots.
Gordon pulls his gun.  Batman turns back.  The SWATS watch.
GORDON: Dent's in there with them.  We have
to save Dent!  I have to save Dent!
(to SWAT Leader)
Get ready-
Batman LEAPS from the building, OPENS his cape- SOARS across
the gulf between the two buildings- Gordon puts his weapon
away.  Curses softly.  Turns to the SWAT leader.

QUIETLY as the pieces stick to the laminate- he slips inside-

Batman's eyes glow white as he uses his sonar to look THROUGH

Gordon's phone rings.
GORDON: Hello?  Barbara, calm down-
DENT (O.S.): Hello, Jim.
GORDON: Harvey?  What the hell's going on?
DENT (O.S.): You're about to know what my
suffering is really like...
Gordon looks across at the Prewitt penthouse...
GORDON (O.S.): Where are you?  Where's my family?!
DENT: Where my family died.
Click.  Gordon looks at the SWAT leader.  Pale.
125.
SWAT LEADER: Red Team.  Go!
Gordon moves to the door off the roof.

INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

Batman GRABS the Armed Clown, drops him, silently.  He goes
to disarm him- THE WEAPON IS DUCT-TAPED TO THE CLOWN'S HANDS.
Batman RIPS off the clown mask: STARING, FRIGHTENED EYES- MOUTH DUCT-TAPED SHUT... it's
ENGEL.: Batman looks up: Four more clowns line the windows, weapons
duct-taped to their hands.  On SONAR: he looks into where the
hostages are crouched... the "PATIENTS" and "DOCTORS" are
carrying weapons- these are the Joker's men... Above them
SWATS RAPPEL FROM THE ROOFTOP.  ~In the stairwells, two more
teams prepping.
BATMAN: Don't.  Move.
Engel nods, terrified.

Batman yanks the clown along the floor using his grapple gun-

Batman takes out the SWATS with fists and BATARANGS-
The last SWAT aims at BATMAN- behind him a "DOCTOR" raises a
shotgun... behind the "Doctor" Batman can see through the
wall at SWATS preparing to breach... Batman VAULTS over the
SWAT into a two-foot kick into the "Doctor's" chest-

INT. STAIRWELL, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

The Swats BLAST OUT THE WALL- the team leader steps up to the

of his team look at each other.  Steel themselves.  Move in
through the hole...

INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

As the SWATS race in they find Engel, terrified, next to a
pile of unconscious "hostages", and their team leader, one
end of an absailing rope tied around his waist.  Batman is on
them, weaving KICKING, PUNCHING, and, with one hand, clipping
carabinners looped to the absailing rope onto their webbing
of vests.
Batman steps back- picks up the team leader- SWAT weapons aim
at him- he hurls the Team Leader out the window... the SWATS
watch him go... the rope pays out... one by one they are
YANKED out of the window...

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS

A SNIPER watches through his scope as the six man SWAT team
soars out of the window and drops.  The line snaps taut and
they hang, like a mountaineering team in crisis.  Batman,
crouched in the broken window, secures the line.
SNIPER: What the hell's he doing?
Batman looks right at the sniper-  Raises his grapple gun-
BAM.: The bat grapple smashes into the Sniper's scope- the
rifle is YANKED out of his hands.

Batman races past a dazed Engel...

And 340 votes for.
The passengers avoid eye contact with each other.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Corrections Officers are in a phalanx in the corner,
facing off against hundreds of menacing Prisoners.
PRISONER 1: Do you wanna die!
The Warden and his men look at each other.  At the clock.

INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT

Batman WRESTLES with the Rotweilers- a blinding mass of
Batman, black fur and bared teeth-
The Joker POPS a switchblade.  Moves in to the mass- Batman
KICKS OFF the last of the dogs- the Joker JABS his knife into
Batman's RIBS-
THE JOKER: All the old familiar places.
Batman recoils in pain.  The Joker BUTTS him- KNEES him-
ENERGY explodes from his lean frame- he KICKS the injured
Batman back towards the glass...

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Pilot [Passenger Ferry] looks at the remote in his hands.
PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY]: I voted for it.  Same as most of you.
Doesn't seem right that we should all

Someone calls out from the back.
128.
PASSENGER 3: So do it!
PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY]: I didn't say I'd do it.  Don't
forget.  We're still here.  Which
means they haven't killed us, yet,
either.
He sets the remote down on a bench in the front of the
lounge.  The other passengers and guardsmen stare at it...

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

A HUGE, TATTOOED PRISONER pushes his way to the front.  He
walks towards the Warden, who is sweating, looking at the
remote.
TATTOOED PRISONER: You don't wanna die.  But you don't
know how to take a life.  Give it to
me.
The Warden looks at the remote.  At the clock.
TATTOOED PRISONER: These men will kill you and take it,
anyway.  Give it to me, you can tell
people I took it by force... give it
to me and I'll do what you should
have done ten minutes ago.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT

Everyone stares at the remote.  One minute left.  The
Businessman stands.  Walks over and picks it up.
BUSINESSMAN: No one wants to get their hands
dirty.  Fine.  I'll do it.  Those men
on that boat made their choices.
They chose to murder and steal.  It
makes no sense for us to die, too.
He looks at the other passengers.  No one makes eye contact.

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Warden slowly hands him the REMOTE.  The Prisoner looks
at it.  He looks the Warden in the eye...
Then TOSSES the remote out the window.
Warden, prisoners and officers are stunned.

EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT

Batman FLIES backwards THROUGH THE WINDOW- glass flying- the
Joker KICKS out a wooden brace holding up the STEEL FRAME-
Batman's arms fly up as it comes crashing down onto his neck-
saved by his protective gauntlets.  Batman GRUNTS as the
Joker STEPS onto the steel beam...
THE JOKER: If we don't stop fighting, we're
going to miss the fireworks.
BATMAN: There won't be any fireworks.
Batman STRUGGLES to keep the beam from CRUSHING his neck...

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT

The Businessman stares at the remote in his hands.  Finally,
he puts it down.  Sits down.  Waits to die.
The clock strikes MIDNIGHT.

Batman indicates the clock...  twelve o'clock.
BATMAN: What were you hoping to prove?  That

The Joker looks at the clock...

The Passengers brace.  Look at the clock.  Confused...

The smile disappears from the Joker's face.
BATMAN: You're alone.
The Joker CROUCHES down, hovering above Batman's face and
arms.  Shows him the remote.
THE JOKER: Can't rely on anyone these days.
The Joker ARMS the remote...
THE JOKER: Have to do everything yourself.  I
always have- and it's not always
easy...
130.
(MORE): (smiles, remembering)
You know how I got these scars?
Batman looks up at him.
BATMAN: No.  But I know how you get these-
Batman's SCALLOP BLADES FIRE OUT OF HIS GAUNTLET, nailing the
Joker in the chest and arm- he STAGGERS back- Batman, freed,
leaps forward- KICKS HIM OVER THE EDGE- GRABS the remote-
The Joker GIGGLES as he FALLS, enjoying the ride.  Something
SLAMS into his leg, and he JERKS to a stop- BATMAN'S GRAPPLE.
The Joker HOLLERS in pain as Batman HAULS him up.
THE JOKER: Just couldn't let me go, could you?
I guess this is what happens when an
unstoppable force meets an immovable
object.  You truly are incorruptible,
aren't you?
Batman secures the Joker UPSIDE DOWN.  The Joker is LAUGHING.
THE JOKER: You won't kill me out of some
misplaced sense of self-
righteousness... and I won't kill you
because you're too much fun.  We're
going to do this forever.
BATMAN: You'll be in a padded cell, forever.
THE JOKER: Maybe we can share it.  They'll need
to double up, the rate this city's
inhabitants are losing their minds...
BATMAN: This city just showed you it's full
of people ready to believe in good.
The Joker looks up at him.  A twinkle in his eye.
THE JOKER: Till their spirit breaks completely.
Until they find out what I did with
the best of them.  Until they get a
good look at the real Harvey Dent,
and all the heroic things he's done.
(indicates ferry)
Then those criminals will be straight
back onto the streets and Gotham will
understand the true nature of
heroism.

THE JOKER (cont'd)
(MORE): You didn't think I'd risk losing the
battle for the soul of Gotham in a
fist fight with you?  You've got to
have an ace in the hole.  Mine's
Harvey.
Batman hauls the Joker up, nose to nose.
BATMAN: What did you do?
THE JOKER: I took Gotham's white knight.  And I
brought him down to my level.  It
wasn't hard- madness is like gravity.
All it takes is a little push.
Joker laughs.  Batman leaves him to the SWATS.
BATMAN: Lucius.
Find Harvey Dent.

Gordon peers into the darkness.
GORDON: Dent?
No reply.  Gordon makes his way deeper.  Up the stairs.

INT. SECOND FLOOR, BURNT WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

Gordon spots Barbara and their two children huddled together.
He moves towards them- Barbara is shaking her head-
WHAM!: Dent cracks Gordon over the head with his gun.  Dent
disarms Gordon, rolls him over.  He turns to look at the
ENORMOUS hole in the floor.  From this side, in the
moonlight, Dent looks completely normal.
DENT: This is where they brought her,
Gordon.  After your people handed her
over.  This is where they bound her.
This is where she suffered.  This is
where she died.
GORDON: I know.  I was here.  Trying to save
her.
Dent TURNS, revealing his dark side.
132.
THE JOKER (cont'd)
DENT: But you didn't, did you?
GORDON: I couldn't.
DENT: Yes, you could.
DENT: If you'd listened to me- if you'd
stood up against corruption instead
of doing your deal with the devil.
GORDON: I was trying to fight the mob-
Dent MOVES towards Gordon.
DENT: You wouldn't dare try to justify
yourself if you knew what I'd lost.
Have you ever had to talk to the
person you love most, wondering if
you're about to listen to them die?
You ever had to lie to that person?
Tell them it's going to be all right,
when you know it's not?  Well, you're
about to find out what that feels
like.  Then you'll be able to look me
in the eye and tell me you're sorry.
Dent turns- steps over to Barbara- puts the gun to her temple-
GORDON: Harvey.  Put the gun down.  You're
not going to hurt my family.
DENT: No, just the person you need most.
(cocks gun)
So is it your wife?
GORDON: Put the gun down.
Dent moves the gun to point at Gordon's little girl.
GORDON: Please, Harvey...
Dent moves to James Gordon.  Brushes the hair out of the
boy's eyes with the muzzle.  Gordon SNAPS.
GORDON: Goddamit.
Stop pointing that gun at
my family, Dent.
133.
DENT: We have a winner.
Dent pulls the boy away from his mother.
BARBARA: No!  Jim stop him!  Don't let him!
Dent walks James past Gordon to the edge of the burnt floor.
He touches the raw wood at the edge of the floor.
GORDON: I'm sorry, Harvey.  For everything.
But, please.  Please don't hurt him.

Cop cars descend on the warehouse.

INT. SECOND FLOOR, BURNT WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Dent looks at Gordon, FURIOUS.
DENT: You brought your cops?
GORDON: All they know is there's a situation.
They don't know who, or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.
DENT: You think I want to escape?!  There's
no escape from this-
Dent indicates his face.  His suffering.
GORDON: No one needs to escape, because no
one's done anything wrong.  And
nobody has to.
Dent chuckles.  A macabre sight.
DENT: I've done plenty wrong, Gordon.  Just
not quite enough.  Yet.
Dent squeezes the gun a little tighter against the little
boy's neck.  The boy WHIMPERS.
BATMAN: You don't want to hurt the boy, Dent.
Dent turns.  Batman steps from the shadows.
134.
DENT: It's not about what I want.  It's
about what's fair.
(to Gordon and Batman)
You thought we could be decent men in
an indecent world.  You thought we
could lead by example.  You thought
the rules could be bent but not
break... you were wrong.  The world
is cruel.
(shows his coin)
And the only morality in a cruel
world is chance.  Unbiased.
Unprejudiced.  Fair.
BATMAN: Nothing fair ever came out of the
barrel of a gun, Dent.
DENT: (shows the coin)
His boy's got the same chance she
had.  Fifty-fifty.
Batman steps closer, desperate, trying to reach Dent.
BATMAN: What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance.  We decided to act.  We
three.  We knew the risks and we
acted as one.  We are all responsible
for the consequences.
Dent looks at Batman.  Pleading.
DENT: Then why was it only me who lost
everything?
Batman looks into Dent's eyes.  Emotional.
BATMAN: It wasn't.
DENT: (furious)
The Joker chose me!
BATMAN: Because you were the best of us.  He
wanted to prove that even someone as
good as you could fall.
DENT: (bitter)
And he was right.
135.
BATMAN: But your fooling yourself if you
think you're letting chance decide.
You're the one pointing the gun,
Harvey.  So point it at the people
who were responsible.  We all acted
as one.  Gordon.  Me.  And you.
Dent is listening, the wheels in his deranged mind turning.
DENT: Fair enough.
Dent eases his grip on the boy.
DENT: You first.
He points the gun at Batman.  FLIPS the coin.  TAILS.  He
SHOOTS.  Batman COLLAPSES to the ground, clutching his gut.
DENT: My turn.
He points the gun at his own head.  FLIPS the coin.  HEADS.
He looks a little disappointed.
Finally, he points the gun back at Gordon's son.
DENT: Your turn, Gordon.
GORDON: You're right, Harvey.  Rachel's death
was my fault.  But punish me-
DENT: I'm about to.  Tell your son it's
going to be all right, Gordon.  Lie.
Like I lied.
Gordon looks up.  Pained.  Locks eyes with his son.
GORDON: It's going to be all right, son.
Dent FLIPS the coin.  High.  Dent's eyes FOLLOW the coin up-
Batman HURLS himself at Dent and the boy.
All three of them VANISH over the edge.  A TERRIBLE CRASH-
then silence, but for the sound of DENT'S COIN, SPINNING on
the floor at the edge of the hole.
Gordon, horrified, RUNS to the edge- peers down-
Dent lies at the bottom of the hole, his neck broken.  DEAD.
The coin stops spinning, GOOD SIDE UP.
136.
Gordon's son swings into view, HANGING from Batman, who is
holding onto a JOIST with all his strength...
Gordon reaches down to GRAB his son- HAULS him up...
Batman FALLS..., dropping and dropping, SMASHING THROUGH
protruding WOOD and PIPES... He lands HARD near Dent.

Gordon races down the stairs.  Rushes over to Batman.
JAMES: Dad, is he okay?
Gordon crouches at Batman's side.  The Batman GRASPS Gordon's
arm.  STAGGERS to his feet.
GORDON: Thank-you.
BATMAN: You don't have to-
GORDON: Yes, I do.
Gordon and Batman stare down at Dent's body.  Grave.
GORDON: The Joker won.
Gordon stares down at SCARRED SIDE of Harvey Dent.
GORDON: Harvey's prosecution, everything he
fought for, everything Rachel died
for.  Undone.  Whatever chance Gotham
had of fixing itself... whatever
chance you gave us of fixing our
city...  dies with Harvey's
reputation.  We bet it all on him.
The Joker took the best of us and
tore him down.  People will lose all
hope.
BATMAN: No.  They won't.
(looks at Gordon)
They can never know what he did.
137.
GORDON: (incredulous)
Five dead?  Two of them cops?  We
can't sweep that under-
BATMAN: No.  But the Joker cannot win.
Batman crouches to Dent's body.
BATMAN: Gotham needs its true hero.
Gently, he turns Dent's head so the good side of his face is
up.  Gordon looks from Dent's face to Batman.  Understanding.
GORDON: You?  You can't-
BATMAN: Yes, I can.
Batman stands.  Faces Gordon.
BATMAN: You either die a hero or live long
enough to see yourself become the
villain. I can do those things
because I'm not a hero, like Dent.  I
killed those people.  That's what I
can be.
GORDON: (angry)
No, you can't!  You're not!
Batman hands Gordon his police radio.
BATMAN: I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.
INSERT CUT: GORDON STANDS AT A PODIUM AT DENT'S FUNERAL.

A POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH, clasped between finger and thumb: a
crude, crime scene flash picture of a MAN’S BODY lying on a
decaying wooden floor, a BLOODY MESS where his head should
be.
The image in the photo starts to FADE as we SUPER TITLES. The
hand holding the photo suddenly FANS it in a rapid FLAPPING
motion, then holds it still. The image fades more, and again
the picture is FANNED.
As TITLES END the image fades to nothing. The hand holding
the photo FLAPS it again, then places it at the front of a
POLAROID CAMERA.: The camera SUCKS the blank picture up, then the FLASH BURSTS.
The Polaroid camera is lowered, revealing the sweaty, heavy-
breathing face of LEONARD (mid-30’s). There are droplets of
blood across his face. Leonard stares, satisfied, at
something on the ground in front of him. There is WET BLOOD
on his BLUE SHIRT and BEIGE SUIT. His hand opens and catches
a HANDGUN which leaps up into his grasp.
Still staring, he crouches down and pulls a BODY off the
floor by the wet hair of its BLOODY HEAD. He slowly inserts
the barrel of the gun into the bloody mess where the mouth
should be.
Leonard FLINCHES. A DEAFENING ROAR as wet red leaps off his
face and suit and head, with a SPASM, reassembles itself
into the face of TEDDY (40’s, moustache) and we-

A late model Jaguar bumps across some railroad tracks and
approaches a large, clearly abandoned DERELICT BUILDING.
Leonard is driving. He wears a BEIGE SUIT and BLUE SHIRT (no
blood). Next to him is TEDDY. Leonard stops the car next to a
PICKUP TRUCK sitting Outside the derelict building. Leonard
kills the engine, staring at the pickup.
LEONARD: Looks like somebody’s home.
Teddy looks from Leonard to the pickup and back.
TEDDY: That thing’s been here for years.
Leonard gets out of the Jaguar and moves to the pickup. He
inspects it with a methodical, practiced eye. Teddy follows.
LEONARD: I think you’re wrong. These tracks aren’t             *
more than a few days old.
Leonard opens the door of the pickup and searches the
interior. On the dirty vinyl of the passenger seat he finds     *
six BULLETS. Leonard picks two of them up and studies them.     *
He drops them onto the dashboard then SHUTS the door.           *
LEONARD (cont’d)
Let’s take a look inside.
Leonard walks towards the house, patting his jacket pockets.
Teddy leans on the pickup, uneasy, watching Leonard.

Leonard stands in the dimly-lit, decaying former hallway. He
pulls a stack of POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS out of his pocket and
leafs through them as Teddy starts walking towards him.
Leonard finds a photo showing Teddy with a shit-eating grin
standing in front of the pickup truck. On the broad white
strip beneath the photo is handwritten: “TEDDY GAMMELL TEL. 555 0134”
Leonard flips the photo over. On the white strip on the back,
in the same small handwriting.

Leonard stuffs the Polaroids back into his pocket, reaches
around to the back of his waistband and draws a HANDGUN,
keeping it out of Teddy’s line of sight. Teddy enters, wary.
TEDDY: Find anything? Didn’t think so, let’s go,
yeah?
Leonard neither replies nor turns around. Teddy, worried,
affects a casual air, shrugging dismissively,
TEDDY (cont’d)
Fuck this.
Teddy turns and heads for the door. Leonard LEAPS on him,
pistol-whipping him furiously as he shouts:
LEONARD: YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID! YOU BEG
FORGIVENESS, THEN YOU PAY!
Teddy is down. Leonard DRAGS him back, deeper into the dark
house. Leonard is in a frenzy. He dumps Teddy at the end of
the hall and stands over him. Teddy SPITS BLOOD.
TEDDY: You don’t have a clue, you freak.
Leonard crouches down and grabs Teddy by the lapels.
LEONARD: Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife’s

enjoying Leonard’s growing anxiety.

C’mon, Lenny – we’ll take a look down

Leonard glances fearfully at the door, then looks at Teddy.
He THRUSTS the barrel of his gun into Teddy’s mouth and WE
ARE AT THE SHOT FROM THE END OF THE OPENING SEQUENCE. Teddy
panics, shaking his head, trying to talk around the metal,

Leonard lies on the queen-sized bed. He lifts his head.
LEONARD (V.O.): So you’re in some motel room...
He gets up, surveys the room as if for the first time. He
wears BOXERS and a PLAID WORK SHIRT.
LEONARD (cont’d)

There is a room key on the dresser. The plastic tag

spotting something over Leonard’s shoulder.
BURT: That guy’s here already.
Burt TAPS the POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of Teddy which is sitting
on the counter. Leonard picks up the photo and turns to see
Teddy APPROACHING the glass door of the office. Leonard
watches carefully as Teddy shambles up to the office door. A
BELL CHIIIES as Teddy enters and breaks into his shit-eating
grin. Leonard slips the photo into his pocket.
TEDDY: Lenny!
Leonard nods in apparent recognition, wary.
LEONARD: It’s Leonard... like I told you before.
Teddy pretends to think hard.
TEDDY: Did you? I musta forgot. I’m Teddy.                   *

Leonard, wearing BOXERS and PLAID WORK SHIRT, takes the

LEONARD (V.0.): Nothing except the Gideon Bible.
He leafs through a couple off pages, then DROPS the Bible back

Sammy Jankis had the same problem. He                 *

Leonard writes another message beneath these two:

LEONARD: That’s the thing. I have this condition.
BURT: Condition?
LEONARD: I have no memory.
BURT: Amnesia?
LEONARD: No. It’s different. I have no short-term
memory. I know who I am and all about
myself, but since my injury I can’t make
any new memories. Everything fades. If we
talk for too long, I’ll forget how we
started. I don’t know if we’ve ever met
before, and the next time I see you I
won’t remember this conversation. So if I
seem strange or rude, that’s probably...
He notices that Burt is staring at him as if he were an
exotic insect.

“SHAVE THIGH”: Leonard looks into the bag, then pulls out a can of SHAVING
FOAM, and a pack of DISPOSABLE RAZORS. He runs the hot water,
steps back and lifts his foot onto the sink. He is awkward
and uncomfortable. He notices an ICE BUCKET by the sink.

Leonard, in BEIGE SUIT and BLUE SHIRT flushes the urinal,

“REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS”: He stares at the message for a second, thoughtful, then tries
to scrub the writing off his skin. To his surprise, it is
INDELIBLE. Leonard looks at it, quizzical, then notices some
markings on his wrist, pulling his sleeve back to get a
better look. He can read the start of a message:
“THE FACTS:”: Leonard is about to roll his sleeve up further when the
restroom door opens and a MAN enters. Leonard dries his
hands, then exits the rest room.

Polaroids, flipping through them. Someone taps him on his
shoulder and he turns to see the smiling face of a waiter.
WAITER: Sir? You left these at your table.
Leonard looks down. The waiter hands him a BROWN ENVELOPE and
a MOTEL ROOM KEY (DISCOUNT INN, ROOM 304). On the envelope is
a handwritten message: “FOR LEONARD, FROM NATALIE”
Leonard looks at his Polaroid photograph of the outside of
the Discount Inn motel. There is an address written beneath
it (7254 Lincoln Street).                                       *

Leonard, BROWN ENVELOPE in hand, finds the door to room 304.
21   INT. DISCOUNT INN ROOM 304 – DAY <<COLOUR SEQUENCE>>         21 *
Leonard enters, looks around as if for the first time. An
anonymous motel room, except that tacked to one wall is a
HAND-DRAWN CHART showing the layout of some streets, and
stuck to the edges of the chart are POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS,
with ARROWS DRAWN from each photograph to a spot on the map.
Leonard inspects the photos. Some are buildings, some are
people. All have the HANDWRITTEN NOTES on the broad white strip
underneath the image.
Leonard gets Polaroids out of his pocket. The first one is of
the Discount Inn. He STICKS it onto an already-squashed lump    *
of blue tack at the end of an ARROW drawn from a location on
the outskirts of town.
The second photo is a blurred shot of a Brunette turning in a
doorway. The name NATALIE is written under the picture.
Leonard flips it over. On the back are two handwritten
messages. The first one has been completely scribbled over,
but the other one reads: “SHE HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY”
Leonard nods, then sticks the photo to the chart. He steps
back looking over the Polaroids one by one: Natalie, Burt,
Discount Inn, Teddy.                                            *
Leonard sits at the desk and opens the BROWN ENVELOPE. He
takes out a photocopy of a CAR REGISTRATION and a DRIVER’S
LICENSE. Both are in the name of JOHN EDWARD GAMMELL, but       *
when Leonard looks at the picture on the license, he
recognizes the face. Leonard moves back to his wall chart,
finds the Polaroid of Teddy and compares it to the license
photo.
LEONARD (V.O.): This guy told me his name was Teddy.
He turns the photo over and examines the white stop on the
back. It says only: “DON’T BELIEVE HIS LIES”

the Polaroid. A couple of rings, then it’s answered.

LEONARD: John Gammell?
TEDDY: Lenny, it’s Teddy. Look, stay there,

Leonard hangs up, thinking. He looks at the writing on the
back of his hand, then pulls back his sleeve to reveal the words:
“THE FACTS:”: Leonard removes his jacket, then starts pulling off his shirt.
He has WRITING TATTOOED ALL OVER HIS CHEST, STOMACH AND ARMS.
MESSAGES in different styles of writing, some CRUDE, some
ELABORATE. The messages run in all directions, some UPSIDE-
DOWN, some BACKWARDS. Leonard examines his tattoos,
methodically. From Leonard’s POV, the most striking is an
upside—down tattoo on his BELLY which says: “PHOTOGPAPH: HOUSE, CAR, FRIEND, FOE”
On one FOREARM it says:
“THE FACTS::
FACT 1. MALE:
FACT 2. WHITE”: On the other FOREARM: “FACT 3. FIRST NAME: JOHN OR JAMES

And immediately below this, in elegant, neat lettering: “FACT 6. CAR LICENSE NUMBER: SG13 7IU”                          *

Leonard turns the photo face down, takes a pen and writes: “HE IS THE ONE”
Leonard drops the pen. Thinks. He looks at his chest through
the mirror and a backwards tattoo suddenly BECOMES CLEAR: “JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE”
Leonard buttons his blue shirt, then writes on the back of
Teddy’s picture:

Random images of a woman (30’s, black hair, plain). Jump cuts
of details: a smile, eating, tucking her hair behind her ear,
pulling on a pair of trousers, watching TV, shouting in
anger. Sitting on the edge of the bed in her underwear, she
TURNS as Leonard pinches her thigh.
LEONARD (V.O.): You can only feel details. Bits and
pieces which you didn’t bother to put
into words. And extreme moments you feel
even if you don’t want to. Put it
together and you get the feel of the
person, enough to know how much you miss
them, and how much you hate the person
who took them away.

Leonard opens his eyes. Natalie is looking at him. She nods

NATALIE: I wrote an address in there, too. Might
be useful. It’s this abandoned place

a MOTEL ROOM KEY.

Leonard watches the people’s movements carefully. We see

LEONARD (V.0.) (cont’d)
It’s complicated. You might catch a sign
but attach the wrong meaning to it. If
someone touches their nose while they’re
talking, experts will tell you it means
they’re lying. It really means they’re
nervous, and people get nervous for all

LEONARD: I’d just become an investigator when I
came across Sammy. Mr Samuel R. Jankis -
strangest case ever. Guy’s 58, semi-
retired accountant. He and his wife had
been in this car accident... nothing too
serious, but he’s acting funny — he
can’t get a handle on what’s going on.

Sammy can‘t remember anything for more

can’t do shit, medical bills pile up,
his wife calls the insurance company and
I get sent in.

Sammy rolls a small GLASS BOTTLE between the palms of his
hands. Mrs. Jankis rolls up her sleeve. Leonard watches as
Sammy takes a SYRINGE and pushes the needle through the
rubber of the bottle. The label is marked “INSULIN”.
LEONARD (V.O.)(cont’d)
The crazy part was that this guy who
couldn’t follow the plot of “Green
Acres” could do the most complicated
things as long as he had learned them
before the accident...
Sammy INVERTS the bottle and syringe, DRAWS the insulin into
the syringe, withdraws the needle, holds it up to check for
bubbles, TAPPING it delicately.
LEONARD (V.0.) (CONT’D): ... and as long as he kept his mind on
what he was doing.
Sammy wipes a spot on Mrs. Jankis’ arm with a swab, then
gently PINCHES the skin and confidently INSERTS the needle.     *

Don’t remember what you’ve discovered or
how. Your notes might be unreliable.
LEONARD: Memory’s unreliable.
Teddy snorts.
LEONARD (cont’d)
No, really. Memory’s not perfect. It’s
not even that good. Ask the police,
eyewitness testimony is unreliable. The
cops don’t catch a killer by sitting
around remembering stuff. They collect
facts, make notes, draw conclusions.
Facts, not memories: that’s how you
investigate. I know, it’s what I used to
do. Memory can change the shape of a room
or the color of a car. It’s an
interpretation, not a record. Memories
can be changed or distorted and they’re
irrelevant if you have the facts.
TEDDY: You really want to find this guy?
LEONARD: He took away the woman I love and he took
away my memory. He destroyed everything;
my life and my ability to live.
TEDDY: You’re living.
LEONARD: Just for revenge. That’s what keeps me
going. It’s all I have.
Teddy considers this.

you learn stuff like riding a bike,
things you don’t think about, you just
get better through practice. Call it
muscle memory, whatever, but it’s a
completely different part of the brain

NATALIE: (amused)
Lenny, before you go, can I have my shirt
back please?
She tosses him his blue shirt. Leonard looks down at the
white shirt which he has put on. It is way too small.

SAMMY: Ah! What the fuck?!
DOCTOR: It’s a test, Sammy.
SAMMY EXTENDS A TREMBLING MIDDLE FINGER.
SAMMY: Yeah? Test this you fucking quack.
Sequence of JUMP CUTS of Sammy extending his MIDDLE FINGER
and RECOILING in shock from the objects.
LEONARD (V.O.): Even with total short-term memory loss,
Sammy should’ve learned to instinctively
stop picking up the wrong objects. All
previous cases of short-term memory loss
had responded to conditioning in some
way. Sammy didn’t respond at all.

We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn’t covered for mental

rejecting a big claim.
Leonard looks into the mirror.
LEONARD (cont’d)
Conditioning didn’t work for Sammy, so
he became helpless. But it works for me.
I live the way Sammy couldn’t. Habit and
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

Natalie nods, wary of Leonard’s barely concealed anger.
Leonard thrusts a Polaroid photo in her face.
LEONARD (cont’d)
Who the fuck is Dodd?
The photo is of a MAN who is BOUND, GAGGED, and BLOODY. On
the back of the photo: “GET RID OF HIM, ASK NATALIE”
Natalie takes the picture and examines it.

NATALIE: Calm down. You’re not into anything. It
was my problem, you offered no help. It’s
got nothing to do with your
investigation.
LEONARD: That’s the problem! How can I find John
G. when I don’t know what’s going on?!
How did you get me into this?!
NATALIE: Leonard, you offered to help when you saw
what this guy did to me.
She gestures at the BRUISING on her face.
LEONARD: How do I know he did that to you?
NATALIE: I came to you straight after he did it. I
showed you what he’d done and asked for
your help.
LEONARD: So I just take your word?
NATALIE: Yes.
LEONARD: (sighs)
Something feels wrong. I think someone’s
fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill

NATALIE: This has nothing to do with you. You
helped me out, and I’m grateful.
She tries to rip the picture. Leonard watches her try. The
plastic is too strong.
LEONARD: You have to burn them.
Natalie scrunches it up and throws it down. Leonard and
Natalie sit down on the couch.
NATALIE: You decided to help me. Trust yourself.
Trust your own judgment. You can
question everything, you can never know
anything for sure.
LEONARD: There are things you know for sure.
NATALIE: Such as?
LEONARD: I know the feel of the world.
(reaches forward)
I know how this wood will sound when I
knock.
(raps knuckles on coffee table)
I know how this glass will feel when I
pick it up.
(handles glass)
Certainties. You think it’s knowledge,
but it’s a kind of memory, a kind you
take for granted. I can remember so much.
(runs hands over objects)
I know the feel of the world,

jacket.
Leonard takes his jacket off and places it on the back of the
couch, patting the pockets as he does so.
LEONARD: It’s not easy to be calm when —
NATALIE: Just relax.
She reaches for his arm and unbuttons his cuff, revealing the
end of Leonard’s tattoos.
NATALIE (cont’d)
You don’t seem the type.
She pushes back the sleeve, trying to read the tattoo.
Leonard watches her.                                            *
NATALIE (cont’d)

She starts to unbutton his shirt. He watches. Natalie gasps
as she opens Leonard’s shirt and pulls it back over his
shoulders. She tilts her head, trying to read the different
messages.
NATALIE (cont’d)
It’s backwards.                                       *

NATALIE: His name was Jimmy.
LEONARD: What happened?
NATALIE: He went to meet somebody and didn’t come

NATALIE: A guy called Teddy.

the bureau and opens drawers. Empty. He goes to the closet
and OPENS it.
Inside is a BOUND and GAGGED MAN on the floor, knees against
chest. His mouth is taped up with silver electrical tape,
stained with DRIED BLOOD from his swollen nose. He looks up
at Leonard, blinking in the sudden bright light, TERRIFIED.

Leonard replaces the gag and SHUTS the closet.
TEDDY: I’m not gonna help you kill this guy, if

LEONARD: No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Leonard moves to the dresser and starts methodically emptying
his pockets. He pulls a Polaroid out of his inside jacket
pocket.

Leonard, NAKED, looks in the mirror, then RUNS THE SHOWER
then steps under it, shutting the PEBBLED PLASTIC STALL DOOR.
Leonard SHOWERS. He turns the water off, then hears the DOOR
BEING UNLOCKED. Leonard freezes, standing in the SHOWER
STALL, NAKED and DRIPPING. Through the distortion of the
PEBBLED PLASTIC DOOR, Leonard sees a FIGURE enter the
bathroom and start pissing into the toilet. The distorted
Figure turns and approaches the shower stall, becoming
clearer as it gets closer, then YANKS the door open. It is
Dodd (WITHOUT INJURIES). He is SHOCKED to see the naked
Leonard. Leonard BURSTS out of the shower stall, SMASHING
Dodd against the wall.
Dodd STRUGGLES around, grabbing at the SLIPPERY, naked
Leonard. Dodd PUSHES against Leonard, SLASMMING him into the
sink.
Leonard has his arms around Dodd’s neck. Leonard SMASHES
Dodd’s head sideways into the wall, HARD.
Dodd SLUMPS to the floor. Leonard exhales. Dodd puts a FIST
in Leonard’s crotch, then GRABS his neck as he doubles over.
Dodd uses Leonard to pull himself off the floor then PUNCHES
the side of his head and pushes him HARD, Leonard FLAILING
wildly, GRABBING THE EMPTY VODKA BOTTLE from by the sink as
he falls back into the bedroom. Dodd reaches into his INSIDE
POCKET.: 51.
77   INT. DODD’S MOTEL ROOM — DAY <<COLOUR SEQUENCE>>             77
Leonard STUMBLES in, naked, from the bathroom, swings around,
HITTING Dodd square in the face with the empty vodka bottle,
which does not break.
Dodd lies still on the floor, bleeding, his hand still in his
inside jacket pocket. Leonard stands above him, naked,
dripping wet, catching his breath.
There is a KNOCK at the door.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.): Housekeeping.
The sound of a KEY entering the lock. Leonard LEAPS for the
door and flips the privacy latch.
LEONARD: Not just now!
Leonard listens to the maid withdraw her key. Leonard
SEARCHES Dodd, finding his GUN in his inside pocket. Leonard
examines the weapon, then starts to search the room. Leonard
finds an overnight bag at the bottom of the closet. Inside it
there are some clothes, spare ammunition, a large hunting
knife, and a roll of SILVER ELECTRICAL TAPE.
Leonard WRAPS the electrical tape around Dodd’s wrists, then
across his mouth. Leonard finishes taping up Dodd, then sits
him on the edge of the bed. Leonard takes a POLAROID
PHOTOGRAPH of the bloody, taped-up Dodd.
Leonard shoves Dodd into the closet, takes out a NOTE and
consults it, then writes “DODD” on the white strip on the
front of the photograph. He flips the picture over and writes
on the strip on the back, in smaller writing: “GET RID OF HIM, ASK NATALIE”
Leonard dresses, puts the Polaroid into the inside pocket of
his jacket. He looks again at the note. It says: “DODD, MOUNTCREST INN ON 5TH STREET, ROOM 6”                    *
“PUT HIM ONTO TEDDY OR JUST GET RID OF HIM FOR NATALIE”
Leonard picks the stack of Polaroids out of his outside
jacket pocket. He flips through them until he finds the one
of Teddy, then picks up the phone and dials Teddy’s number.
The phone is answered:

Then a BEEP. Leonard does not look like he knows what to do.
LEONARD: Ah, it’s a message for Teddy...                       *
Leonard looks at the note.
LEONARD (cont’d)
I’m at the MOUNTCREST INN on 5th Street,

soon as you get this, it’s important.
This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.
Leonard hangs up. He looks around the room. He slips the
HANDGUN into the bedside drawer, resting it on the GIDEON
BIBLE, then swings his feet up onto the bed and lies down.

Leonard IGNITES the lighter, then holds the needle over the flame.
He examines the NEEDLE, then holds it in the flame again.
Leonard puts down the lighter and picks up a second BALL-

Leonard’s Jaguar pulls up, FAST. Several bits of SHATTERED

He stops at Room 9, listening. The T.V. is on.
Leonard gets a CREDIT CARD out and slips it into the lock
gently, with a practiced hand. He leaves the CARD WEDGED in
the lock, then steps back from the door and KNOCKS.
Leonard watches the POINT OF LIGHT in the PEEPHOLE to Room 9.
The point of light GOES OUT. Leonard KICKS the door in,
SMASHING THE ROOM’S OCCUPANT BACK INTO THE ROOM.
Leonard stands over him, looking down. The man is
unconscious, blood on his face. Something is not right.
LEONARD (V.O.): Is this the guy?
Leonard looks down at his NOTE. The room number given is 6.
Leonard looks at the “9” on the door, then down at the
unconscious man.
LEONARD (cont’d)
Fuck! Sorry.
Leonard reaches down, GRABS his credit card from where it
landed on the floor, and backs out of the doorway, shutting
the door on the Unconscious Man.
He MOVES QUICKLY to Room 6, slips his credit card in the lock
and knocks.
No answer, so Leonard slips inside.

EXT. SMALL ALLEY BEHIND A ROW OF TRAILER HOMES – DAY <<COLOUR

LEONARD (V.O.): What the fuck am I doing?
Leonard glances to his right, and through a GAP between two
trailers he catches a glimpse of Dodd on the other side of
the trailer homes, RACING along parallel to Leonard.
LEONARD (V.O.) (CONT’D): Chasing him!
Leonard CUTS down the next gap between trailers, heading FULL
SPEED for Dodd’s side.
Dodd (without bruises) appears again at the other end of the
gap, SEES Leonard, and STARTS RUNNING TOWARDS HIM. There is a
GUN in his hand.
LEONARD (V.O.) (CONT’D): FUCK! He’s chasing me.
Leonard SKIDS to a halt and turns around. A BULLET hits the
dirt by his feet. He clears the end of the trailer and THROWS
himself over a chain link fence, dropping down on the other
side and SCRAMBLING through some bushes. He RACES full tilt
into a parking lot, looking around, desperate. He can hear a
CAR ALARM sounding. He pulls his KEYS OUT and hits the ALARM
switch. Hearing the DOUBLE BEEP as the alarm stops, he spots
the Jaguar.
The Jaguar PEELS OUT just as Dodd emerges from the trailer
park.
85   INT. JAGUAR – DAY <<COLOUR SEQUENCE>>                        85
Leonard is breathing hard, looking around nervously. He
starts knocking BITS OF BROKEN WINDOW GLASS out of the

pieces of paper out of his pockets as he drives.
Leonard finds a NOTE that gives a description of Dodd, along
with the motel and room number where Dodd is staying.

Leonard is in the Jaguar. Dodd (without any bruises) is
standing by the window, aiming his gun at Leonard.
DODD: I haven’t made a strong enough
impression.
LEONARD: (amused)
Don’t be too hard on yourself.
Dodd motions for Leonard to open the passenger side door.
Dodd gets into the passenger seat, gun on Leonard. Leonard
nods to him.
LEONARD: Seat belt.
Leonard starts to reach over his left shoulder with his right
hand as if for the seat belt. Dodd watches Leonard’s right
hand.
With his left hand, Leonard opens the door. He rolls out,
SLAMMING the door in Dodd’s face, and hitting the central
locking on his car keys.
Leonard TAKES OFF across the asphalt. Dodd tries the doors,
then SHOOTS at Leonard, SHATTERING the driver’s side window,
triggering the CAR ALARM.
Dodd climbs through the window and takes off after him.
Leonard slips into a trailer park, TRIPPING as he DIVES into
a gap between two trailers, STUMBLING over the PLASTIC LAWN
FURNITURE and OLD BIKES which litter the narrow gap.
He picks himself up and SPRINTS into the alley behind the
trailers. He races along behind the trailers.
Leonard is RUNNING FURIOUSLY, arms pumping.

Leonard reaches into the bag and pulls out a well-worn
PAPERBACK BOOK, whose cover has long-since been ripped off.

LEONARD’S WIFE: (without looking up)
It’s good.
LEONARD: You’ve read it a hundred times.
LEONARD’S WIFE: I enjoy it.
LEONARD: Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in

He places the BOOK on the fire. He reaches into the bag,
produces a BRA and a HAIRBRUSH. He puts the bra on the fire,
then pulls some BLACK HAIR out of the hairbrush. He holds a
few strands out above the fire until they shrivel up in the
heat. He does this with a larger clump and it produces a
SMALL FLAME so he DROPS it into the fire.
LEONARD (V.O.): Probably tried this before. Probably
burned truckloads of your stuff. Can’t
remember to forget you.
He DROPS the brush onto the fire, pulls a GREEN ALARM CLOCK
out of the bag and adds it to the fire. Once the bag is

Leonard fishes photographs out of his pocket, examining them.
The Landcruiser ACCELERATES until it is uncomfortably close.
Leonard slows, turning into a PARKING LOT. The Landcruiser

LEONARD (V.O.): He seems to know me.
The Landcruiser PULLS ALONGSIDE the Jaguar. Leonard looks

In the dim light he can see a well-worn, COVERLESS PAPERBACK
BOOK on the far bedside table. Next to it is a HAIRBRUSH and
a drinking glass half-full of water. There is a small STUFFED
TOY sitting by the pillow next to Leonard’s head. Leonard’s
eyes are half—closed as he slides his hand onto the other
half of the bed, feeling the residual warmth, smiling.
He props himself up on one arm, rubs his eyes and reaches
over to the SMALL, GREEN ALARM CLOCK, straining to read its
numbers in the dim light. He breathes heavily, sleepily and
shuts his eyes for a second, UTTERLY CONTENT.

I think John G. left it or planted it.

Well, it was a lot for one guy’s
personal use.

How do you know that?
(listens, checks report)
Right, that’s true. It fits.

Too much for personal use, so he deals.
Leonard takes his pen and alters his FILE CARD to read: “TATTOO: FACT 5. DRUG DEALER”
Leonard picks up the NEEDLE/PEN and continues his tattoo.
115  EXT. NATALIE’S HOUSE – DAY <<COLOUR SEQUENCE>>               115
The CAR ALARM of the Jaguar is SOUNDING.
Leonard exits, walks to the car and gets in, switching off
the alarm.
TEDDY (O.S.): You should lock a car as nice as this.
Teddy is in the passenger seat. Leonard, startled, GRABS him
by the throat.
LEONARD: Who the fuck are you?
TEDDY: (gasping)
Teddy. Your buddy.
LEONARD: Prove it.
TEDDY: (gasping)
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about
Sammy.
Leonard lets him go.
LEONARD: What are you doing in my car?
Teddy is now wearing his big grin, rubbing his neck.

TEDDY: Sense of humour went with the memory,
huh? You know why you’re still here,
don’t you?
LEONARD: Unfinished business.
TEDDY: Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you.
Your business here is very much finished.
You’re still here because of Natalie.
LEONARD: Who’s she?
Teddy chuckles.
TEDDY: Whose house do you think you just walked
out of?
Leonard looks at the house. Teddy motions towards Leonard’s
pockets.
TEDDY (cont’d)
Take a look at your pictures, I bet you
got one of her.
Leonard pulls out his Polaroids and flips through them. He
pauses at the one of Natalie. Teddy SWIPES it out of his
hands to get a better look at the blurred image of Natalie
turning in a doorway.
TEDDY (cont’d)
Great shot, Lenny.
Teddy flips the photo over. There is nothing on the back.
Teddy hands it back to Leonard.
TEDDY (cont’d)
You wanna make a note that you can’t
trust her.
LEONARD: Why’s that?
TEDDY: Because she’ll have taken one look at
your clothes and your car and started
thinking of ways to turn the situation to
her advantage. She’s already got you
staying with her, for fuck’s sake.

You can’t stay with her. Let me give you
the name of a motel.
Teddy starts looking for a piece of paper.
TEDDY (cont’d)
Good thing I found you. She’s bad news.
LEONARD: What do you mean “bad news”?
TEDDY: She’s involved with these drug dealers.
Teddy opens the GLOVE COMPARTMENT, finding a STACK OF BEER
MATS from a local bar called FERDY’S.                           *
TEDDY (cont’d)
See these? That’s the bar where she
works. Her boyfriend’s a drug dealer.
She’d take orders for him, arrange meets.
He’d write messages on these, then leave
it on the bar. She’d drop replies when
she served him drinks.
LEONARD: Why should I care?
Teddy starts writing on the BEER MAT.
TEDDY: She’s gonna use you. To protect herself.
LEONARD: From who?
TEDDY: Guys who’ll come after her. Guys who’ll
want to know what happened to her
boyfriend. They’ll want to make somebody
pay. Maybe she’ll try and make it you.
LEONARD: Yeah, well maybe she’ll make it you. Is
that it? You worried she’ll use me
against you?
TEDDY: She couldn’t.
LEONARD: Why not?

TEDDY: (grins)
She has no idea who I am.
LEONARD: Why are you following me?
TEDDY: I’m trying to help you. I knew she’d get
her claws into you. She doesn’t know
anything about your investigation, so
when she offers to help you, it’ll be for
her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not
go back to her. Take out a pen, write
yourself a note, do not trust her.
Leonard takes out his pen, places the picture of Natalie face
down on the dash and writes on the white strip on the back:
“DON’T TRUST HER”:
LEONARD: Happy now?
TEDDY: I won’t be happy until you leave town.
LEONARD: Why?
TEDDY: How long do you think you can hang around
here before people start asking
questions?
LEONARD: What sort of questions?
TEDDY: The sort of questions you should be
asking yourself.
LEONARD: Like what?
TEDDY: Like how’d you get this car? That suit?
LEONARD: I have money.

TEDDY: From what?
LEONARD: My wife’s death. I used to work in
Insurance, we were well covered.
TEDDY: So in your grief you wandered into a
Jaguar dealership?
Leonard says nothing. Teddy laughs.
TEDDY (cont’d)
You haven’t got a clue, have you? You
don’t even know who you are?
LEONARD: Yes, I do. I don’t have amnesia. I
remember everything about myself up until
the incident. I’m Leonard Shelby, I’m
from San Fran –
TEDDY: That’s who you were, Lenny. You don’t
know who you are, who you’ve become since
the incident. You’re wandering around,
playing detective... and you don’t even
know how long ago it was.
Teddy reaches out to Leonard’s lapel, and gently opens his
jacket to reveal the label.
TEDDY (cont’d)
Put it this way. Were you wearing
designer suits when you sold insurance?               *
Leonard looks down at his suit, then back to Teddy.
LEONARD: I didn’t sell –
TEDDY: I know, you investigated. Maybe you need
to apply some of your investigative
skills to yourself.
LEONARD: Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
TEDDY: Don’t go back in there. There’s a motel
out of town.

Teddy hands Leonard the BEER MAT and gets out of the car.
TEDDY (cont’d)
It’s been fun, Lenny.
Teddy walks off. Leonard pulls his Polaroids out of his
pocket and finds the one of Teddy. He places it on the dash,
face up, next to the one of Natalie which is still face down
on the dash. Leonard reads the message he has written on the
back of Natalie’s picture:
“DON’T TRUST HER”: He flips Teddy’s picture over, like a croupier turning a card
at blackjack. On the back it says: “DON’T BELIEVE HIS LIES”
Leonard purses his lips in surprised frustration. He grabs
his pen and scribbles on the back of Natalie’s picture,
obliterating the words:
“DON’T TRUST HER”: He flips Natalie’s picture over and considers her blurred
image. He looks up at her house, then picks up the BEER MAT,
reading the address Teddy has given him.
LEONARD: Fuck it. I need my own place.
Leonard starts the engine.
116  EXT. DISCOUNT INN - DAY <<COLOUR SEQUENCE>>                  116
Leonard pulls up in his Jaguar, checks the name of the motel
against the note written on the BEER MAT, then heads into the

Leonard comes out of the office, takes a Polaroid of the
front of the motel, and heads for Room 304.

Leonard (boxers, bandaged arm) talks on the phone. He presses   *
the NEEDLE/PEN against his thigh, working on a “D”.
LEONARD: I can’t blame the cops for not taking me
seriously. This is a difficult condition
for people to understand. I mean look at
Sammy Jankis. His own wife couldn’t deal
with it.

I told you about how she tried to get
him to snap out of it?

It got much worse than that. Eventually
Sammy’s wife came to see me at the
office, and I found out all kinds of
shit.
(listens)
She knew that I was the one who had
built he case for Sammy faking it.
118  INT. LEONARD’S OFFICE – DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE##     118
Leonard, in a CHEAP SUIT AND TIE, gets up from behind his
desk to shake hands with Mrs. Jankis. They talk, Leonard
nodding as he listens. Mrs. Jankis is crying.
LEONARD (V.O.): She told me about life with Sammy, how
she’d treated him. It had got to the
point where she’d get Sammy to hide food
all around the house, then stop feeding
him to see if his hunger would make him
remember where he’d hidden the stuff.
She wasn’t a cruel person, she just
wanted her old Sammy back.
The tearful Mrs. Jankis gives Leonard a determined look.
MRS. JANKIS: Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and
you decided that he was faking –
LEONARD: Mrs. Jankis, the company’s position
isn’t that Sammy is “faking” anything,
just that his condition can’t be shown –
MRS. JANKIS: I’m not interested in the company
position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know
your honest opinion about Sammy.
LEONARD: We shouldn’t even be talking this way
while the case is still open to appeal.
MRS. JANKIS: I’m not appealing the decision.
LEONARD: Then why are you here?

118  CONTINUED:                                                   118:
MRS. JANKIS: Mr. Shelby, try and understand. When I
look into Sammy’s eyes, I don’t see some
vegetable, I see the same old Sammy.
What do you think it’s like for me to
suspect that he’s imagining this whole                *
problem? That if I could just say the
right thing he’d snap out of it and be
back to normal? If I knew that my old
Sammy was truly gone, then I could say
goodbye and start loving this new Sammy.              *
As long as I have doubt, I can’t say
goodbye and move on.
LEONARD: Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
MRS. JANKIS: I want you to forget the company you
work for for thirty seconds, and tell me
if you really think that Sammy is faking
his condition.
Leonard plays with his letter opener, thinking.
MRS. JANKIS (cont’d)
I need to know what you honestly
believe.
LEONARD: (looks at Mrs. Jankis)
I believe that Sammy should be
physically capable of making new
memories.
MRS. JANKIS: Thank you.

She turns and comes towards the front door. Her face is SWOLLEN

Leonard OPENS the door for her. She RUSHES past him.            *
LEONARD: What happened?
Natalie, intensely AGITATED, FUMBLES with things in her purse.
NATALIE: What does it look like?!
She turns to Leonard so that he can see the full extent of
her injuries. Her eye is SWELLING UP, and her lip is SPLIT.
NATALIE (cont’d)
He beat the shit out of me.

cubes to her swollen cheek while Leonard gently uses a damp
paper towel to wipe the blood from her upper lip.

No pens here, I’m afraid. You’re never

There had to be a second man. I was
struck from behind, I remember. It’s
about the last thing I do remember. But               *
the police didn’t believe me.

The gun and stuff?

John G. was clever. He took the dead
man’s gun and replaced it with the sap
that he’d hit me with. He left my gun and
left the getaway car. He gave the police
a complete package. They found a sap with
my blood on it in the dead man’s hand,
and they only found my gun. They didn’t
need to look for anyone else. I was the
only guy who disagreed with the facts,
and I had brain damage.                               *

T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and

Leonard nods. Natalie heads for the door.
LEONARD: Oh, one thing.
Natalie TURNS. Leonard snaps her picture with his Polaroid
camera. He lowers the camera and smiles.
LEONARD (cont’d)
Something to remember you by.
Natalie smiles unconvincingly, perturbed, and exits. Leonard
sits down on the couch and writes “Natalie” on the white
strip under her photo as it develops into the blurred image
of Natalie which we have seen before. He takes out his other
Polaroids, flipping through them.

his hand (“REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS”), then switches the TV off.
He starts to examine his Polaroids.

Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
Leonard shrugs.
NATALIE (cont’d)
Well, it seems like Jimmy knows you. He
told me about you. Said you were staying
over at the Discount. Then, just this                 *
evening, this cop comes in here looking               *
for you. Looking for a guy who couldn’t
remember stuff, who’d forget how he got

Leonard does not find this funny.

finish this conversation I won’t remember
how it started, and the next time I see
you I won’t know that I’ve ever met you

Leonard pulls the beer mat out of his pocket and hands it to
Natalie.

Leonard drops a tidy blob of spit into the beer, shakes his
head, revolted. Natalie places the mug on the bar in front of

Leonard pushes Teddy out of the basement.
TEDDY: I think you’ve got the wrong idea -
Leonard GRABS Teddy.
LEONARD: Who was that? He’s not the guy. He knew               *
me.                                                   *
TEDDY                                       *: Sure he did. He raped your wife and                   *
fucked up your brain.                                 *

TEDDY: A load of amphetamine I told him I had.

TEDDY: (chuckles)
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone
who’ll listen. “Remember Sammy Jankis,
remember Sammy Jankis”. Great story. Gets
better every time you tell it. So you
lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing
wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if
there’s a few little things you’d rather
not remember?

I dunno... your wife surviving the

Sammy -

stopped asking myself why a long time

strung out to realize that your wife

Leonard reaches into his sports bag, grabs a LIGHTER and
sparks a flame. Leonard holds the PHOTO in the flame until it
CATCHES LIGHT, MELTING and BLACKENING. The flames go out,
having destroyed the entire image but for an arm resting on a
floor. Leonard sticks the remnants into his jacket pocket. He
looks in the rear-view mirror at Teddy, who scrabbles around
in the bushes.
LEONARD (V.0.) (CON’T’D): ... but right now I need to be.
Teddy’s GREY SEDAN is parked in front of Leonard. Leonard
looks at the sedan, then reaches into his sports bag for a
PEN and a FILE CARD. He writes on the file card: “TATTOO: I’VE DONE IT”
Leonard looks from the card to Teddy’s sedan.
LEONARD (V.O.)(cont’d)
Maybe I’m not finished yet. Maybe I need

ROLL CREDITS:

What like a bullet can undeceive!"
—Herman Melville
Your wife always used to say you'd be late for your own funeral.
Remember that? Her little joke because you were such a slob—always
late, always forgetting stuff, even before the incident.
Right about now you're probably wondering if you were late for hers.
You were there, you can be sure of that. That's what the picture's for—
the one tacked to the wall by the door. It's not customary to take
pictures at a funeral, but somebody, your doctors, I guess, knew you
wouldn't remember. They had it blown up nice and big and stuck it right
there, next to the door, so you couldn't help but see it every time you
got up to find out where she was.
The guy in the picture, the one with the flowers? That's you. And what
are you doing? You're reading the headstone, trying to figure out who's
funeral you're at, same as you're reading it now, trying to figure why
someone stuck that picture next to your door. But why bother reading
something that you won't remember?
She's gone, gone for good, and you must be hurting right now, hearing
the news. Believe me, I know how you feel. You're probably a wreck. But
give it five minutes, maybe ten. Maybe you can even go a whole half
hour before you forget.
But you will forget—I guarantee it. A few more minutes and you'll be
heading for the door, looking for her all over again, breaking down
when you find the picture. How many times do you have to hear the news
before some other part of your body, other than that busted brain of
yours, starts to remember?
Never-ending grief, never-ending anger. Useless without direction.
Maybe you can't understand what's happened. Can't say I really
understand, either. Backwards amnesia. That's what the sign says. CRS
disease. Your guess is as good as mine.
Maybe you can't understand what happened to you. But you do remember
what happened to HER, don't you? The doctors don't want to talk about
it. They won't answer my questions. They don't think it's right for a
man in your condition to hear about those things. But you remember
enough, don't you? You remember his face.
This is why I'm writing to you. Futile, maybe. I don't know how many
times you'll have to read this before you listen to me. I don't even
know how long you've been locked up in this room already. Neither do
you. But your advantage in forgetting is that you'll forget to write
yourself off as a lost cause.
Sooner or later you'll want to do something about it. And when you do,
you'll just have to trust me, because I'm the only one who can help
you.
______________________________
EARL OPENS ONE EYE after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles
interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large
enough for him to read from the bed. An alarm clock is ringing
somewhere. He reads the sign, blinks,reads it again, then takes a look
at the room.
It's a white room, overwhelmingly white, from the walls and the
curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread. The alarm
clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white
curtains. At this point Earl probably notices that he is lying on top
of his white comforter. He is already wearing a dressing gown and
slippers.
He lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again. It says, in
crude block capitals, THIS IS YOUR ROOM. THIS IS A ROOM IN A HOSPITAL.
THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE NOW.
Earl rises and takes a look around. The room is large for a hospital—
empty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three directions. Two
doors and a window. The view isn't very helpful, either—a close of
trees in the center of a carefully manicured piece of turf that
terminates in a sliver of two-lane blacktop. The trees, except for the
evergreens, are bare—early spring or late fall, one or the other.
Every inch of the desk is covered with Post-it notes, legal pads,
neatly printed lists, psychological textbooks, framed pictures. On top
of the mess is a half-completed crossword puzzle. The alarm clock is
riding a pile of folded newspapers. Earl slaps the snooze button and
takes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing
gown. He pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light. He rifles
the papers on the desk, looks quickly through the drawers. Eventually
he finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the window.
Another sign is taped just above the box. It says in loud yellow
letters, CIGARETTE? CHECK FOR LIT ONES FIRST, STUPID.
Earl laughs at the sign, lights his cigarette, and takes a long draw.
Taped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf paper
headed YOUR SCHEDULE.
It charts off the hours, every hour, in blocks: 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.
is labeled go BACK TO SLEEP. Earl consults the alarm clock: 8:15. Given
the light outside, it must be morning. He checks his watch: 10:30. He
presses the watch to his ear and listens. He gives the watch a wind or
two and sets it to match the alarm clock.
According to the schedule, the entire block from 8:00 to 8:30 has been
labeled BRUSH YOUR TEETH. Earl laughs again and walks over to the
bathroom.
The bathroom window is open. As he flaps his arms to keep warm, he
notices the ashtray on the windowsill. A cigarette is perched on the
ashtray, burning steadily through a long finger of ash. He frowns,
extinguishes the old butt, and replaces it with the new one.
The toothbrush has already been treated to a smudge of white paste. The
tap is of the push-button variety—a dose of water with each nudge. Earl
pushes the brush into his cheek and fiddles it back and forth while he
opens the medicine cabinet. The shelves are stocked with single-serving
packages of vitamins, aspirin, antidiuretics. The mouthwash is also
single-serving, about a shot-glass-worth of blue liquid in a sealed
plastic bottle. Only the toothpaste is regular-sized. Earl spits the
paste out of his mouth and replaces it with the mouthwash. As he lays
the toothbrush next to the toothpaste, he notices a tiny wedge of paper
pinched between the glass shelf and the steel backing of the medicine
cabinet. He spits the frothy blue fluid into the sink and nudges for
some more water to rinse it down. He closes the medicine cabinet and
smiles at his reflection in the mirror.
"Who needs half an hour to brush their teeth?"
The paper has been folded down to a minuscule size with all the
precision of a sixth-grader's love note. Earl unfolds it and smooths it
against the mirror. It reads—
IF YOU CAN STILL READ THIS, THEN YOU'RE A FUCKING COWARD.
Earl stares blankly at the paper, then reads it again. He turns it
over. On the back it reads—
P.S.: AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS, HIDE IT AGAIN.
Earl reads both sides again, then folds the note back down to its
original size and tucks it underneath the toothpaste.
Maybe then he notices the scar. It begins just beneath the ear, jagged
and thick, and disappears abruptly into his hairline. Earl turns his
head and stares out of the corner of his eye to follow the scar's
progress. He traces it with a fingertip, then looks back down at the
cigarette burning in the ashtray. A thought seizes him and he spins out
of the bathroom.
He is caught at the door to his room, one hand on the knob. Two
pictures are taped to the wall by the door. Earl's attention is caught
first by the MRI, a shiny black frame for four windows into someone's
skull. In marker, the picture is labeled YOUR BRAIN. Earl stares at it.
Concentric circles in different colors. He can make out the big orbs of
his eyes and, behind these, the twin lobes of his brain. Smooth
wrinkles, circles, semicircles. But right there in the middle of his
head, circled in marker, tunneled in from the back of his neck like a
maggot into an apricot, is something different. Deformed, broken, but
unmistakable. A dark smudge, the shape of a flower, right there in the
middle of his brain.
He bends to look at the other picture. It is a photograph of a man
holding flowers, standing over a fresh grave. The man is bent over,
reading the headstone. For a moment this looks like a hall of mirrors
or the beginnings of a sketch of infinity: the one man bent over,
looking at the smaller man, bent over, reading the headstone. Earl
looks at the picture for a long time. Maybe he begins to cry. Maybe he
just stares silently at the picture. Eventually, he makes his way back
to the bed, flops down, seals his eyes shut, tries to sleep.
The cigarette burns steadily away in the bathroom. A circuit in the
alarm clock counts down from ten, and it starts ringing again.
Earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles,
interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large
enough for him to read from the bed.
______________________________
You can't have a normal life anymore. You must know that. How can you
have a girlfriend if you can't remember her name? Can't have kids, not
unless you want them to grow up with a dad who doesn't recognize them.
Sure as hell can't hold down a job. Not too many professions out there
that value forgetfulness. Prostitution, maybe. Politics, of course.
No. Your life is over. You're a dead man.The only thing the doctors are
hoping to do is teach you to be less of a burden to the orderlies. And
they'll probably never let you go home, wherever that would be.
So the question is not "to be or not to be," because you aren't. The
question is whether you want to do something about it. Whether revenge
matters to you.
It does to most people. For a few weeks, they plot, they scheme, they
take measures to get even. But the passage of time is all it takes to
erode that initial impulse. Time is theft, isn't that what they say?
And time eventually convinces most of us that forgiveness is a virtue.
Conveniently, cowardice and forgiveness look identical at a certain
distance. Time steals your nerve.
If time and fear aren't enough to dissuade people from their revenge,
then there's always authority, softly shaking its head and saying, We
understand, but you're the better man for letting it go. For rising
above it. For not sinking to their level. And besides, says authority,
if you try anything stupid, we'll lock you up in a little room.
But they already put you in a little room, didn't they? Only they don't
really lock it or even guard it too carefully because you're a cripple.
A corpse. A vegetable who probably wouldn't remember to eat or take a
shit if someone wasn't there to remind you.
And as for the passage of time, well, that doesn't really apply to you
anymore, does it? Just the same ten minutes, over and over again. So
how can you forgive if you can't remember to forget?
You probably were the type to let it go, weren't you? Before. But
you're not the man you used to be. Not even half. You're a fraction;
you're the ten-minute man.
Of course, weakness is strong. It's the primary impulse. You'd probably
prefer to sit in your little room and cry. Live in your finite
collection of memories, carefully polishing each one. Half a life set
behind glass and pinned to cardboard like a collection of exotic
insects. You'd like to live behind that glass, wouldn't you? Preserved
in aspic.
You'd like to but you can't, can you? You can't because of the last
addition to your collection. The last thing you remember. His face. His
face and your wife, looking to you for help.
And maybe this is where you can retire to when it's over. Your little
collection. They can lock you back up in another little room and you
can live the rest of your life in the past. But only if you've got a
little piece of paper in your hand that says you got him.
You know I'm right. You know there's a lot of work to do. It may seem
impossible, but I'm sure if we all do our part, we'll figure something
out. But you don't have much time. You've only got about ten minutes,
in fact. Then it starts all over again. So do something with the time
you've got.
______________________________
EARL OPENS HIS EYES and blinks into the darkness. The alarm clock is
ringing. It says 3:20, and the moonlight streaming through the window
means it must be  he early morning. Earl fumbles for the lamp, almost
knocking it over in the process. Incandescent light fills the room,
painting the metal furniture yellow, the walls yellow, the bedspread,
too. He lies back and looks up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tiles
above him, interrupted by a handwritten sign taped to the ceiling. He
reads the sign two, maybe three times, then blinks at the room around
him.
It is a bare room. Institutional, maybe. There is a desk over by the
window. The desk is bare except for the blaring alarm clock. Earl
probably notices, at this point, that he is fully clothed. He even has
his shoes on under the sheets. He extracts himself from the bed and
crosses to the desk. Nothing in the room would suggest that anyone
lived there, or ever had, except for the odd scrap of tape stuck here
and there to the wall. No pictures, no books, nothing. Through the
window, he can see a full moon shining on carefully manicured grass.
Earl slaps the snooze button on the alarm clock and stares a moment at
the two keys taped to the back of his hand. He picks at the tape while
he searches through the empty drawers. In the left pocket of his
jacket, he finds a roll of hundred-dollar bills and a letter sealed in
an envelope. He checks the rest of the main room and the bathroom. Bits
of tape, cigarette butts. Nothing else.
Earl absentmindedly plays with the lump of scar tissue on his neck and
moves back toward the bed. He lies back down and stares up at the
ceiling and the sign taped to it. The sign reads, GET UP, GET OUT RIGHT
NOW. THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU.
Earl closes his eyes.
_____________________________
They tried to teach you to make lists in grade school, remember? Back
when your day planner was the back of your hand. And if your
assignments came off in the shower, well, then they didn't get done. No
direction, they said. No discipline. So they tried to get you to write
it all down somewhere more permanent.
Of course, your grade-school teachers would be laughing their pants wet
if they could see you now. Because you've become the exact product of
their organizational lessons. Because you can't even take a piss
without consulting one of your lists.
They were right. Lists are the only way out of this mess.
Here's the truth: People, even regular people, are never just any one
person with one set of attributes. It's not that simple. We're all at
the mercy of the limbic system, clouds of electricity drifting through
the brain. Every man is broken into twenty-four-hour fractions, and
then again within those twenty-four hours. It's a daily pantomime, one
man yielding control to the next: a backstage crowded with old hacks
clamoring for their turn in the spotlight. Every week, every day. The
angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man, and in turn to the
sex addict, the introvert, the conversationalist. Every man is a mob, a
chain gang of idiots.
This is the tragedy of life. Because for a few minutes of every day,
every man becomes a genius. Moments of clarity, insight, whatever you
want to call them. The clouds part, the planets get in a neat little
line, and everything becomes obvious. I should quit smoking, maybe, or
here's how I could make a fast million, or such and such is the key to
eternal happiness. That's the miserable truth. For a few moments, the
secrets of the universe are opened to us. Life is a cheap parlor trick.
But then the genius, the savant, has to hand over the controls to the
next guy down the pike, most likely the guy who just wants to eat
potato chips, and insight and brilliance and salvation are all
entrusted to a moron or a hedonist or a narcoleptic.
The only way out of this mess, of course, is to take steps to ensure
that you control the idiots that you become. To take your chain gang,
hand in hand, and lead them. The best way to do this is with a list.
It's like a letter you write to yourself. A master plan, drafted by the
guy who can see the light, made with steps simple enough for the rest
of the idiots to understand. Follow steps one through one hundred.
Repeat as necessary.
Your problem is a little more acute, maybe, but fundamentally the same
thing.
It's like that computer thing, the Chinese room. You remember that? One
guy sits in a little room, laying down cards with letters written on
them in a language he doesn't understand, laying them down one letter
at a time in a sequence according to someone else's instructions. The
cards are supposed to spell out a joke in Chinese. The guy doesn't
speak Chinese, of course. He just follows his instructions.
There are some obvious differences in your situation, of course: You
broke out of the room they had you in, so the whole enterprise has to
be portable. And the guy giving the instructions—that's you, too, just
an earlier version of you. And the joke you're telling, well, it's got
a punch line. I just don't think anyone's going to find it very funny.
So that's the idea. All you have to do is follow your instructions.
Like climbing a ladder or descending a staircase. One step at a time.
Right down the list. Simple.
And the secret, of course, to any list is to keep it in a place where
you're bound to see it.
______________________________
HE CAN HEAR THE BUZZING through his eyelids. Insistent. He reaches out
for the alarm clock, but he can't move his arm.
Earl opens his eyes to see a large man bent double over him. The man
looks up at him, annoyed, then resumes his work. Earl looks around him.
Too dark for a doctor's office.
Then the pain floods his brain, blocking out the other questions. He
squirms gain, trying to yank his forearm away,  the one that feels like
it's burning. The arm doesn't move, but the man shoots him another
scowl. Earl adjusts himself in the chair to see over the top of the
man's head.
The noise and the pain are both coming from a gun in the man's hand—a
gun with a needle where the barrel should be. The needle is digging
into the fleshy underside of Earl's forearm, leaving a trail of puffy
letters behind it.
Earl tries to rearrange himself to get a better view, to read the
letters on his arm, but he can't. He lies back and stares at the
ceiling.
Eventually the tattoo artist turns off the noise, wipes Earl's forearm
with a piece of gauze, and wanders over to the back to dig up a
pamphlet describing how to deal with a possible infection. Maybe later
he'll tell his wife about this guy and his little note. Maybe his wife
will convince him to call the police.
Earl looks down at the arm. The letters are rising up from the skin,
weeping a little. They run from just behind the strap of Earl's watch
all the way to the inside of his elbow. Earl blinks at the message and
reads it again. It says, in careful little capitals, I RAPED AND KILLED
YOUR WIFE.: ______________________________
It's your birthday today, so I got you a little present. I would have
just bought you a beer, but who knows where that would have ended?
So instead, I got you a bell. I think I may have had to pawn your watch
to buy it, but what the hell did you need a watch for, anyway?
You're probably asking yourself, Why a bell? In fact, I'm guessing
you're going to be asking yourself that question every time you find it
in your pocket. Too many of these letters now. Too many for you to dig
back into every time you want to know the answer to some little
question.
It's a joke, actually. A practical joke. But think of it this way: I'm
not really laughing at you so much as with you.
I'd like to think that every time you take it out of your pocket and
wonder, Why do I have this bell? a little part of you, a little piece
of your broken brain, will remember and laugh, like I'm laughing now.
Besides, you do know the answer. It was something you learned before.
So if you think about it, you'll know.
Back in the old days, people were obsessed with the fear of being
buried alive. You remember now? Medical science not being quite what it
is today, it wasn't uncommon for people to suddenly wake up in a
casket. So rich folks had their coffins outfitted with breathing tubes.
Little tubes running up to the mud above so that if someone woke up
when they weren't supposed to, they wouldn't run out of oxygen. Now,
they must have tested this out and realized that you could shout
yourself hoarse through the tube, but it was too narrow to carry much
noise. Not enough to attract attention, at least. So a string was run
up the tube to a little bell attached to the headstone. If a dead
person came back to life, all he had to do was ring his little bell
till someone came and dug him up again.
I'm laughing now, picturing you on a bus or maybe in a fast-food
restaurant, reaching into your pocket and finding your little bell and
wondering to yourself where it came from, why you have it. Maybe you'll
even ring it.
Happy birthday, buddy.
I don't know who figured out the solution to our mutual problem, so I
don't know whether to congratulate you or me. A bit of a lifestyle
change, admittedly, but an elegant solution, nonetheless.
Look to yourself for the answer.
That sounds like something out of a Hallmark card. I don't know when
you thought it up, but my hat's off to you. Not that you know what the
hell I'm talking about. But, honestly, a real brainstorm. After all,
everybody else needs mirrors to remind themselves who they are. You're
no different.
______________________________
THE LITTLE MECHANICAL VOICE PAUSES, then repeats itself. It says, "The
time is 8:00 a.m. This is a courtesy call." Earl opens his eyes and
replaces the receiver. The phone is perched on a cheap veneer headboard
that stretches behind the bed, curves to meet the corner, and ends at
the minibar. The TV is still on, blobs of flesh color nattering away at
each other. Earl lies back down and is surprised to see himself, older
now, tanned, the hair pulling away from his head like solar flares. The
mirror on the ceiling is cracked, the silver fading increases. Earl
continues to stare at himself, astonished by what he sees. He is fully
dressed, but the clothes are old, threadbare in places.
Earl feels the familiar spot on his left wrist for his watch, but it's
gone. He looks down from the mirror to his arm. It is bare and the skin
has changed to an even tan, as if he never owned a watch in the first
place. The skin is even in color except for the solid black arrow on
the inside of Earl's wrist, pointing up his shirtsleeve. He stares at
the arrow for a moment. Perhaps he doesn't try to rub it off anymore.
He rolls up his sleeve.
The arrow points to a sentence tattooed along Earl's inner arm. Earl
reads the sentence once, maybe twice. Another arrow picks up at the
beginning of the sentence, points farther up Earl's arm, disappearing
under the rolled-up shirtsleeve. He unbuttons his shirt.
Looking down on his chest, he can make out the shapes but cannot bring
them into focus, so he looks up at the mirror above him.
The arrow leads up Earl's arm, crosses at the shoulder, and descends
onto his upper torso, terminating at a picture of a man's face that
occupies most of his chest. The face is that of a large man, balding,
with a mustache and a goatee. It is a particular face, but like a
police sketch it has a certain unreal quality.
The rest of his upper torso is covered in words, phrases, bits of
information, and instructions, all of them written backward on Earl,
forward in the mirror.
Eventually Earl sits up, buttons his shirt, and crosses to the desk. He
takes out a pen and a piece of notepaper from the desk drawer, sits,
and begins to write.
______________________________
I don't know where you'll be when you read this. I'm not even sure if
you'll bother to read this. I guess you don't need to.
It's a shame, really, that you and I will never meet. But, like the
song says, "By the time you read this note, I'll be gone."
We're so close now. That's the way it feels. So many pieces put
together, spelled out. I guess it's just a matter of time until you
find him.
Who knows what we've done to get here? Must be a hell of a story, if
only you could remember any of it. I guess it's better that you can't.
I had a thought just now. Maybe you'll find it useful.
Everybody is waiting for the end to come, but what if it already passed
us by? What if the final joke of Judgment Day was that it had already
come and gone and we were none the wiser? Apocalypse arrives quietly;
the chosen are herded off to heaven, and the rest of us, the ones who
failed the test,  just keep on going, oblivious. Dead already,
wandering around long after the gods have stopped keeping score, still
optimistic about the future.
I guess if that's true, then it doesn't matter what you do. No
expectations. If you can't find him, then it doesn't matter, because
nothing matters. And if you do find him, then you can kill him without
worrying about the consequences. Because there are no consequences.
That's what I'm thinking about right now, in this scrappy little room.
Framed pictures of ships on the wall. I don't know, obviously, but if I
had to guess, I'd say we're somewhere up the coast. If you're wondering
why your left arm is five shades browner than your right, I don't know
what to tell you. I guess we must have been driving for a while. And,
no, I don't know what happened to your watch.
And all these keys: I have no idea. Not a one that I recognize. Car
keys and house keys and the little fiddly keys for padlocks. What have
we been up to?
I wonder if he'll feel stupid when you find him. Tracked down by the
ten-minute man.  Assassinated by a vegetable.
I'll be gone in a moment. I'll put down the pen, close my eyes, and
then you can read this through if you want.
I just wanted you to know that I'm proud of you. No one who matters is
left to say it. No one left is going to want to.
EARL'S EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, staring through the window of the car.
Smiling eyes. Smiling through the window at the crowd gathering across
the street. The crowd gathering around the body in the doorway. The
body emptying slowly across the sidewalk and into the storm drain.
______________________________
A stocky guy, facedown, eyes open. Balding head, goatee. In death, as
in police sketches, faces tend to look the same. This is definitely
somebody in particular. But really, it could be anybody.
Earl is still smiling at the body as the car pulls away from the curb.
The car? Who's to say? Maybe it's a police cruiser. Maybe it's just a
taxi.
As the car is swallowed into traffic, Earl's eyes continue to shine out
into the night, watching the body until it disappears into a circle of
concerned pedestrians. He chuckles to himself as the car continues to
make distance between him and the growing crowd.
Earl's smile fades a little. Something has occurred to him. He begins
to pat down his pockets; leisurely at first, like a man looking for his
keys, then a little more desperately. Maybe his progress is impeded by
a set of handcuffs. He begins to empty the contents of his pockets out
onto the seat next to him. Some money. A bunch of keys. Scraps of
paper.
A round metal lump rolls out of his pocket and slides across the vinyl
seat.  Earl is frantic now. He hammers at the plastic divider between
him and the driver, begging the man for a pen. Perhaps the cabbie
doesn't speak much English. Perhaps the cop isn't in the habit of
talking to suspects. Either way, the divider between the man in front
and the man behind remains closed. A pen is not forthcoming.
The car hits a pothole, and Earl blinks at his reflection in the
rearview mirror. He is calm now. The driver makes another corner, and
the metal lump slides back over to rest against Earl's leg with a
little jingle. He picks it up and looks at it,  curious now. It is a
little bell. A little metal bell. Inscribed on it are his name and a
set of dates. He recognizes the first one: the year in which he was
born. But the second date means nothing to him. Nothing at all.
As he turns the bell over in his hands, he notices the empty space on
his wrist where his watch used to sit. There is a little arrow there,
pointing up his arm. Earl looks at the arrow, then begins to roll up
his sleeve.
_____________________________
"You'd be late for your own funeral," she'd say. Remember? The more I
think about it, the more trite that seems. What kind of idiot, after
all, is in any kind of rush to get to the end of his own story?
And how would I know if I were late,  anyway? I don't have a watch
anymore. I don't know what we did with it.
What the hell do you need a watch for,  anyway? It was an antique.
Deadweight tugging at your wrist. Symbol of the old you. The you that
believed in time.
No. Scratch that. It's not so much that you've lost your faith in time
as that time has lost its faith in you. And who needs it,  anyway? Who
wants to be one of those saps living in the safety of the future, in
the safety of the moment after the moment in which they felt something
powerful? Living in the next moment, in which they feel nothing.
Crawling down the hands of the clock, away from the people who did
unspeakable things to them. Believing the lie that time will heal all
wounds—which is just a nice way of saying that time deadens us.
But you're different. You're more perfect.  Time is three things for
most people, but for you, for us, just one. A singularity. One moment.
This moment. Like you're the center of the clock, the axis on which the
hands turn. Time moves about you but never moves you. It has lost its
ability to affect you. What is it they say? That time is theft? But not
for you. Close your eyes and you can start all over again. Conjure up
that necessary emotion, fresh as roses.
Time is an absurdity. An abstraction. The only thing that matters is
this moment. This moment a million times over. You have to trust me. If
this moment is repeated enough, if you keep trying—and you have to keep
trying—eventually you will come across the next item on your list.
End.
A low KEENING which becomes SCREECHING that BUILDS
and BUILDS until- RED flickers through black as the screen
BURSTS into life: Clouds of REELING BATS silhouetted against
a blood red sky, bolting away from camera, MASSING in the
sky... FORMING a density the shape of an enormous BAT-LIKE
SYMBOL. More BATS mass, swamping the symbol, DARKENING the
screen to- BLACK. Distant children’s LAUGHTER which comes
closer as- SUNLIGHT flickers through black. Sunlight through
trees running through a SUMMER GARDEN. A BOY. Chasing a
GIRL. The Boy reaches a Victorian GREENHOUSE. Stands in the
doorway catching his breath. This is Bruce Wayne, aged 8,
and we are-

EXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR -- DAY

YOUNG BRUCE peers down rows of plants on long trestle
tables.
YOUNG BRUCE: Rachel?
No response. Sunlight streams through wrought iron and
glass. Young Bruce advances, cautious. He is GRABBED from
behind and pulled under a table by a young girl, aged 10.
This is RACHEL. She puts her hand over Young Bruce’s mouth.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.): Rachel?! Master Bruce?!
A woman STRIDES past the windows: MRS.DODSON, Rachel’s
mother, housekeeper of Wayne Manor.
YOUNG BRUCE: (whispering)
What’re you doing?!
RACHEL: (matter-of-fact)
Kidnapping you. They” pay a lot for
precious Brucie.
Young Bruce stares, wide-eyed. She SMILES. He relaxes. Young
Bruce BOLTS out from under the trestle table - SPRINTS for
the back door. Rachel TEARS after him.

EXT. DISUSED KITCHEN GARDEN, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

Young Bruce crouches in the mouth of a DISUSED WELL, peering
over the stone wall at Rachel, who searches for him.
(CONTINUED):

RACHEL: Bruce, I can see you.
Young Bruce suppresses a giggle- the BOARDS beneath him GIVE
WAY and he PLUMMETS into...

INT. OLD WELL -- CONTINUOUS

Young Bruce DROPS thirty feet- LANDS painfully on the rubble
strewn bottom of the shaft.

EXT. KITCHEN GARDEN, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel, hearing, RUNS to the well.
RACHEL:
BRUCE?!!:

INT. OLD WELL -- CONTINUOUS

Young Bruce lifts his head from damp dirt and rocks,
groaning.

EXT. KITCHEN GARDEN, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel SPRINTS towards the house.
RACHEL:
MOM!! MISTER ALFRED!!:

INT. OLD WELL -- CONTINUOUS

Young Bruce, in shock, groans. He hears SQUEALING- freezes,
PEERING into the DARKNESS of an OPENING between rocks...
BATS EXPLODE from the darkness, filling the air. HE
SCREAMSCURLS against their flapping, squawking, fluttering
BLACKNESS.: A JOLT: OLDER GREEN EYES FLICK OPEN, WAKING... in DARKNESS.
Filthy, sweating darkness... and we are in-
3.

INT. BHUTANESE JAIL -- MORNING

The eyes belong to a bearded, weathered, young man’s face.
BRUCE WAYNE aged 28. An OLD ASIAN MAN sits staring at him.
OLD MAN: A dream?
WAYNE: A nightmare.
OLD MAN: Worse than this?
Their cell is a tin box. Light seeps through gaps in the
roof. Shouts ECHO. Wayne shrugs.

EXT. PRISON COURTYARD -- LATER

Wayne and the Old Man line up for gruel. PRISONERS are
scattered in small groups. All eyes on Wayne.
OLD MAN: They are going to fight you.
WAYNE: I fought them yesterday.
OLD MAN: They will fight you every day.
Until they kill you.
Wayne holds out his plate. Watches gruel dribbled onto it.
WAYNE: Can’t they kill me before
breakfast?
Wayne turns from the table. His path is blocked by an
ENORMOUS MAN, backed by six aggressive prisoners. The
Enormous Man SMASHES his plate away.
ENORMOUS MAN: (broken English)
You are in hell, little man...
He PUNCHES Wayne- Wayne goes down hard.
ENORMOUS MAN (CONT’D): ...and I am the devil.
Wayne picks himself up. Dust himself off.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 4.
WAYNE: You’re not the devil...
The Enormous Man SWINGS again- Wayne CATCHES his fist, KICKS
the big man’s knee out an, as he goes down, BOOTS his face.
WAYNE (CONT’D): ...you’re practice.
Six Prisoners RUSH Wayne all at once... Wayne fights
skillfully and hard, FLIPPING one prisoner into another,
KICKING as his arms are held... several Prisoners hit the
deck before- GUNFIRE- two GUARDS break it up, shooting into
the air... they GRAB Wayne.
GUARD: Solitary!
WAYNE: (indignant)
Why?
GUARD: For protection.
WAYNE: I don’t need protection.
The Guard points angrily at the unconscious prisoners.
GUARD: Protection for them.

INT. SOLITARY, BHUTANESE JAIL -- MOMENTS LATER

Wayne is tossed into the dark cell. The door SLAMS.
VOICE (O.S.): I often wonder at the riches to be
found in dark places.
The voice is mellifluous. European. It comes from the
shadows of a deep corner of the cell.
WAYNE: I thought the point of solitary
confinement was the solitary part.
Wayne can make out the profile of a MAN seated in the
corner.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 5.
MAN: These men have mistaken you for a
criminal, Mr.Wayne...
Wayne reacts to his name. The Man steps into the light: powerfully-built, distinguished, in a well-cut SUIT AND TIE.
WAYNE: Who are you?
MAN: My name is merely Ducard. But I
speak for Ra’s Al Ghul. Have you
heard the name?
WAYNE: I’ve heard the legends...master
warrior, international mercenary,
feared by all the underworld...
some even swear he’s immortal.
DUCARD: (smiles)
Ra’s Al Ghul uses theatricality and
deception as powerful weapons.
Ducard approaches Wayne. Looks deep into his eyes.
DUCARD (CONT’D): You have not escaped his notice- a
man like you is here by choice...
or because he is truly lost.
Wayne’s eyes flick away from Ducard’s penetrating gaze.
DUCARD (CONT’D): Ra’s Al Ghul and his League of
Shadows offer a path to those that
are capable of upholding our code.
WAYNE: Code? Aren’t you criminals?
DUCARD: A criminal is simply a man that
someone else thinks...
(gestures around them)
... should be put in jail.
Wayne nods, conceding the point.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 6.
DUCARD (CONT’D): This world is run by tyrants and
corrupt bureaucrats. Our code
respects only the natural order of
things- we’re not bound by their
hypocrisy. Are you?
Ducard moves to the door. Knocks. It is opened by a guard.
DUCARD (CONT’D): There is a rare flower- a blue
doublebloomed poppy- that grows on
the Eastern slopes. Tomorrow you
will be released. Pick one of the
flowers. If you can carry it to the
top of the mountain, you may find
what you are looking for.
WAYNE: And what am I looking for?
Ducard looks at Wayne with a glint in his eye.
DUCARD: Purpose.
The door slams shut leaving Wayne in DARKNESS...

INT. BOTTOM OF THE OLD WELL -- DAY (WAYNE’S MEMORY)

Silence. Young Bruce lies there, exhausted, weeping softly.
MALE VOICE: Bruce?
Young Bruce looks up: a FIGURE, long coat billowing, is
lowered down the shaft... THOMAS WAYNE, Young Bruce’s
father.

EXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Thomas carries his son towards the house. At his side, a 50-
year-old man in a somber suit calmly coils a rope: ALFRED.
ALFRED: Will we be needing an ambulance,
Master Wayne?
THOMAS: We have everything I need to set
the bone. I’ll take him for x-rays
later.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 7.
ALFRED: Very good, sir.
They pass a tearful Rachel standing with her mother.

INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

Thomas carries Bruce up the main stairs. The house is vast
and grand, but full of flowers and life. Bruce’s Mother
(MARTHA) appears at the landing, distraught.
THOMAS: (reassuring)
He’ll be fine.

INT. BRUCE’S BEDROOM, WAYNE MANOR -- LATER

Alfred moves to the bedside. Looks down at Young Bruce.
ALFRED: Took quite a fall, didn’t we?
Young Bruce looks up at Alfred. Manages a slight smile.
ALFRED: And why do we fall, Master Bruce?
Alfred reaches up to the curtains. Young Bruce says nothing.
ALFRED: So that we might better learn to
pick ourselves up.
Alfred smiles gently. PULLS the curtains shut, and we-
CUT TO:: An exquisite double-bloomed BLUE POPPY... and we are-

EXT. HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS -- DAY

A field of the blue poppies. Wayne approaches. Picks one.
Studies its brilliant blue in the cold sunshine.
8.

EXT. TINY HAMLET, HIMALAYAS -- DAY

Wayne, exhausted, freezing, hungry, wanders up the street.
As locals see him they head inside. DOORS SLAMMED, BOLTED.
CHILD (O.S.): No one will help you.
Wayne turns to find a YOUNG CHILD STARING at him. The Child
POINTS at the blue flower pinned to Wayne’s chest. An OLD
MAN appears at the Child’s side.
WAYNE: (weak)
I need food.
OLD MAN: Then turn back.
Wayne looks at the Old Man. Then carries on up the mountain.

EXT. MOUNTAIN -- DAY

Wayne, struggles through DRIVING SNOW up an ICY RIDGE...
He clears the ridge, FLOPS down into the snow, Painfully
raises his scarf-wrapped face to the cutting wind to see a
MONASTERY perched on jagged rock.

EXT. HIMALAYAN FORTIFIED MONASTERY -- DAY

Wayne climbs up the steps to the VAST DOORS of the
monastery. Unwraps a severely FROSTBITTEN FIST. POUNDS
against the icecovered wood, knocks ECHOING deep within.
Nothing. Wayne lowers his forehead to the door, shoulders
wracked by SOBS, pounding accelerating to a FRENZY.
A GRINDING noise from within. Wayne STOPS, straightens. The
doors SWING OPEN to DARKNESS...

INT. GREAT HALL, MONASTERY -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne shuffles forward into a low-ceilinged wooden hall lit
by flickering lamps. Hands trembling, Wayne pulls at brittle
scarves. He STARTS as the doors THUD shut behind him.
At the far end, on a raised platform, sits a dark robbed
figure; RA’S AL GHUL. Wayne moves unsteadily towards him...
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 9.
WAYNE: (hoarse)
Ra’s Al Ghul?
ARMED WARRIORS of various races emerge from the SHADOWS: BOWS taut, SWORDS drawn... NINJAS. Wayne freezes.
DUCARD (O.S.): Wait.
The Warriors hold. Wayne looks at the source of the command: Ducard leans against a nearby pillar.
Wayne reaches into his layers of clothing. Pulls out the
DOUBLE-BLOOMED BLUE POPPY. Holds it out, shaking.
Ra’s Al Ghul starts to speak in Urdu. Ducard TRANSLATES.
DUCARD: Fear has been your guide. But now
you must advance or fear will keep
you on your knees. We will help you
conquer your fear. In exchange you
will renounce the cities of man.
You will live in solitude. You will
be a member of the Leagues of
Shadows. And you will be without
fear.
Ducard takes the flower. Considers its delicate blue petals.
DUCARD (CONT’D): Are you ready to begin?
Ducard threads the flower through the buttonhole of his
lapel. Wayne looks at Ducard, shaking with hunger and
fatigue.
WAYNE: Ready? I... I can barely-
Ducard KICKS him- Wayne Crashes to the floor.
DUCARD: Death does not wait for you to be
ready...
Wayne crawls, gasping. Ducard STRIKES him in the ribs.
DUCARD (CONT’D): Death is not considerate, or fair.
And make no mistake- today, death
is your opponent.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 10.
Ducard turns- WHIPS his leg in a fearsome roundhouse KICK
aimed straight at Wayne’s NECK-
-but Wayne BLOCKS the kick with a lateral movement of his
forearm. He stares at Ducard, eyes BLAZING. Ducard SMILES.
Wayne RISES. Assumes a martial STANCE. Ducard STRIKESWayne
BLOCKS and PARRIES, driving his body through pain into a
series of FLUID, SKILLED moves...
DUCARD (CONT’D): Tiger Crane... Ju Jitsu...
(smiles)
Skilled. But this is not a dance-
Ducard GRAPPLES Wayne, BRAWLING, BITING, ENERGIZED, MESSY...
DUCARD (CONT’D): Facing death you learn the truth... Ducard’s head smashes
Wayne’s cheek- Wayne FALTERS-
DUCARD (CONT’D): You are weak...
Ducard SMASHES him in the groin.
DUCARD (CONT’D): You are alone...
Ducard SLAMS Wayne’s chin, sends him DOWN HARD.
DUCARD (CONT’D): And you are afraid...
Ducard crouches at Wayne’s side. Looks into his glazed eyes.
DUCARD (CONT’D): (curious)
But not of me.
Ducard pulls the flower from his lapel. Leans in close to
replace it on Wayne’s chest, his lips at Wayne’s ear...
DUCARD (CONT’D): Tell us, Wayne...
VIOLENT FLAPPING, SCREECHING BLACK RATS- swarming,
chittering-
DUCARD (V.O.): (whispers)
What do you fear?
11.
Young Bruce’s eyes OPEN, and we are-

INT. BRUCE’S BEDROOM, WAYNE MANOR -- DAWN (WAYNE’S MEMORY)20

Young Bruce, breathing hard. Light cuts across the
bedclothes. He looks to the door. Thomas is there.
THOMAS: (gentle)
The bats again?
Young Bruce nods. Thomas approaches. Sits on the bed.
THOMAS (CONT’D): You know why they attacked you?
(off look)
They were afraid of you.
YOUNG BRUCE: Afraid of me?
THOMAS: You’re a lot bigger than a bat,
aren’t you? All creatures feel
fear.
YOUNG BRUCE: (smiles)
Even the scary ones?
Thomas smiles back, reaches into his dressing gown pocket.
THOMAS: Especially the scary ones.
(thinks)
Here, let me show you something-
(freeze)
But you can’t tell anyone, right?
Young Bruce nods, eager. Thomas pulls out a long jewel case.
He opens it: PEARLS glow in the half-light.
THOMAS (CONT’D): For your mother.
Young Bruce GRINS. Thomas winks at him, SNAPS the case shut.
12.

INT. ELEVATED TRAIN (MONORAIL) -- EVENING

Young Bruce watches the glory of Gotham glide past. His
parents beside him, dressed up- Martha idly stroking her
pearls. She smiles at Thomas.
YOUNG BRUCE: Did you build this train, Dad?
THOMAS: Your great-grandfather built the
first trains in Gotham. The city’s
been good to our family- it was
time to give something back...
Thomas draws a CIRCLE in the CONDENSATION on the window...
THOMAS (CONT’D): A new public transportation system
for the whole city...
Thomas draws SPOKES through the circle, creating a WHEEL.
Thomas TAPS his diagram at the central HUB of the wheel,
then points through the glass to a tall 1930’s SKYSCRAPER.
THOMAS (CONT’D): ...and at the cent... Wayne Tower.

EXT. GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

The monorail train TURNS INWARDS on a "SPOKE"... SHOOTING
towards the central station at the base of Wayne Tower.

INT. CONCOURSE, WAYNE STATION -- MOMENTS LATER

Young Bruce STARES at the MAGNIFICENT STATION. He looks up
through the vaulted glass ceiling... WAYNE TOWER rises
above... Rich ORCHESTRAL STRINGS rise, and we are-

INT. GOTHAM OPERA HOUSE -- LATER

A gilded house packed to the rafters for Boito’s Mefistofle.
Young Bruce seated between his parents, On stage: WITCHLIKE
CREATURES cavort. DARK BIRDS on wires descend, FLAPPING.
Young Bruce STARES, uneasy, at their VIOLENT motions.
INSERT CUT: BATS EXPLODE FROM A DARK CREVICE.
Young Bruce starts breathing faster, STARES fixedly.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 13.
SCREECHING, FLAPPING BLACK BATS SWARM ALL AROUND...
Young Bruce, gulping PANIC breaths, looks around for an
exit- they’re in the middle of a row. He GRABS his Dad’s
arm.
YOUNG BRUCE: (desperate whisper)
Can we go?!
Thomas stares at his son, confused. Martha looks over. Young
Bruce looks at his father, PLEADING. Thomas nods. They make
their way along the row, Thomas nodding apologies...

EXT. SIDE ALLEY, GOTHAM OPERA HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

The Waynes emerge from a side exit. Martha crouches before
Bruce, tries to meet his eyes. He stares down, ashamed.
MARTHA: Bruce, what’s wrong?
THOMAS: He’s fine.
Martha looks up. Thomas gives her a conspiratorial look.
THOMAS (CONT’D): I just needed a bit of air. Bit of
opera goes a long way, right,
Bruce?
Young Bruce looks up at his Dad, who winks. Young Bruce
smiles gratefully.
THOMAS (CONT’D): Come one.
Thomas, coat over his arm, ushers his family down the dark
alley, heading for the WELCOMING GLOW of the main boulevard.
A FIGURE emerges from the shadows in front of them. A MAN.
With a GUN. Shifting uneasily.
MAN: Wallet, jewelry! Fast!
THOMAS: (calm tone)
That’s fine, just take it easy.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 14.
Thomas hands Young Bruce his coat, then reaches for his
wallet. The Man JERKS the gun at Thomas, eyes DARTING. Young
Bruce stares up at the gun TREMBLING in the Man’s hand.
THOMAS (CONT’D): Here you go.
The man GRABS at the wallet but FUMBLES it. It FALLS. The
Man glances down at the wallet then back to Thomas, scared.
THOMAS (CONT’D): (reassuring tone)
It’s fine, it’s fine...
The Man crouches for the wallet, eyes on Thomas.
THOMAS (CONT’D): ...just take it and go.
The Man feels for the wallet, looks at Martha. Her pearls.
MAN: I said jewelry!!
She starts pulling off her rings. The Man JERKS the gun at
her neck. Thomas STEPS protectively in front of his wife.
THOMAS: Hey, just-
BOOM. Young Bruce FLINCHES. Thomas looks down at his
bleeding chest. Then back to the Man, saddened.
Thomas CRUMPLES. Martha SCREAMS. The Man REACHES for
Martha’s pearls- but she SCREAMS desperately for Thomas.
MARTHA:
THOMAS!! THOMAS!!:
MAN: Gimme the damn...
But Martha FLAILS, trying to grab her fallen husband.
The Man SHOOTS her. Then YANKS at her necklace, which
BREAKS. Spilling PEARLS all over the asphalt.
The Man stands. Turns to Young Bruce. Who STARES at him.
Uncomprehending. The Man cannot bear the boy’s gaze...
And then he RUNS. Young Bruce looks at the bodies of his
parents. DROPS to his knees, head down: PEARLS dot the
asphalt beneath him. Some of them are bloody.
15.
Young Bruce starts to SHIVER.

INT. POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

CHAOS: REPORTERS and COPS vying for a piece of the crime of
the decade. In the Captain’s office, Young Bruce.
Bewildered, forgotten. Still clutching his father’s
overcoat.
MALE VOICE (O.S.): Is that your father’s?
Young Bruce looks up: a young beat cop stands over him- JIM
GORDON (29). Gordon crouches, reaches for the coat. Young
Bruce huddles over it, protective.
GORDON: (reassuring)
It’s okay.
Gordon’s tone prompts Young Bruce to trust him. Gordon takes
the coat, DRAPES it gently across Young Bruce’s shoulders.
MALE VOICE (O.S.): GORDON! You gotta stick your nose
into everything!
Gordon turns to CAPTAIN LOEB, who glares at him.
CAPTAIN LOEB: Outta my sight.
Gordon NODS at Young Bruce, whose eyes wish Gordon would
stay. Gordon leaves. Loeb turns to Young Bruce.
CAPTAIN LOEB (CONT’D): Good news... we got him, son.
Young Bruce looks up at him dazed. Uncertain.

EXT. GROUNDS, WAYNE MANOR -- DAY

Snow falls over two open graves. MOURNERS disperse, guided
by SECURITY GUARDS. Alfred stands with Young Bruce. A man
approaches, EARLE (47). He nods at Alfred, crouching.
EARLE: (indicates Alfred)
You’re in excellent hands, Bruce.
And we’re minding the empire. When
you’re all grown up, it’ll be
waiting.
16.
Young Bruce looks blankly at Earle.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR -- LATER

Mourners file towards the gates. Rachel walks with her
mother. Looks up at Bruce’s high window. Sees him watching.
Waves. Young Bruce pauses, then returns the wave.

INT. BRUCE’S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Alfred enters. Looks tenderly at Young Bruce’s back.
ALFRED: I thought I’d prepare a little
supper.
No response. Alfred turns.
ALFRED (CONT’D): Very well.
YOUNG BRUCE (O.S.): Alfred?
Alfred turns back. Young Bruce is looking at him with TEARS
POURING down his cheeks. Alfred tilts his head.
ALFRED: (voice catching)
Master Bruce?
YOUNG BRUCE: It was my fault, Alfred.
Alfred’s mouth opens.
YOUNG BRUCE (CONT’D): I made them leave the theater-
ALFRED: Oh, no, no, no-
Alfred moves to Young Bruce, taking the boy in his arms.
YOUNG BRUCE: If I hadn’t got scared-
ALFRED: No, no, Master Bruce. Nothing you
did. Nothing anyone ever did can
excuse that man.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 17.
Alfred holds Young Bruce away to look directly into his
eyes.
ALFRED (CONT’D): It’s his, and his alone. Do you
understand?
Young Bruce nods. Then BURIES his face in Alfred’s chest,
sobbing.
YOUNG BRUCE: I miss them, Alfred. I miss them so
much.
ALFRED: (whispering)
So do I, Master Bruce. So do I.
Tears well in Alfred’s eyes as he HOLDS the boy, watching
snowflakes swirl past the window.
DUCARD (V.O.): And do you still feel responsible?

INT. PASSAGEWAY, MONASTERY -- DAY

Ducard leads Wayne along a screened passage overlooking
extraordinary mountains.
WAYNE: My anger outweighs my guilt.
Ducard opens a door...

INT. DOJO, MONASTERY -- DAY

Leads Wayne onto a MEZZANINE LEVEL stacked with boxes and
bottles. NINJAS pour powders into packets, mixing compounds.
Ducard takes a pinch of a powder- throws it down- BANG!
Wayne FLINCHES- Ducard SMILES good-naturedly.
DUCARD: Advanced techniques of Ninjitsu
employ explosive powders.
WAYNE: As weapons?
DUCARD: Or distractions. Theatricality and
deception are powerful agents.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 18.
Ducard hands Wayne a pinch of the powder.
DUCARD (CONT’D): To be a great warrior is not
enough. Flesh and blood, however
skilled, can be destroyed... you
must be more than just a man in the
minds of your opponents.
Wayne listens to this. Tosses the powder- BANG!

EXT. FROZEN LAKE, HIMALAYAS -- DAY

Wayne and Ducard CIRCLE each other on the ICE, SWORDS poised
to strike. Dark figures in the white and blue landscape.
Ducard STRIKES at Wayne, who DEFLECTS the blow using a
SILVER GAUNTLET with THREE SCALLOPS (thick, hook-like
projections). Ducard SKIDS left, breath STEAMING, feinting
with his sword.
Wayne steps sideways on the ice, his foot landing on a thin
patch which CREAKS, water BUBBLING underneath.
DUCARD: Mind your surrounding. Always.
Wayne STRIKES- Ducard BLOCKS with his own BRONZE GAUNTLET.
Wayne SLIPS right and FLIES IN with a short THRUST- Ducard’s
arm flips down in a backhand move-
Ducard CATCHES Wayne’s sword in one of his SCALLOPS.
DUCARD (CONT’D): Your parent’s death was not your
fault...
Ducard ROTATES his arm, WRENCHING Wayne’s sword from his
grasp- it SKIDS along the ice.
DUCARD (CONT’D): ...it was your father’s.
Wayne, ENRAGES, dives at Ducard, SWINGING at him with the
scallops, FURIOUS, RECKLESS. Ducard parries with his sword,
they LOCK- noses inches apart, Wayne BREATHING... ANGRY...
DUCARD (CONT’D): Anger does not change the fact that
your father failed to act.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 19.
WAYNE: The man had a gun!
DUCARD: Would that stop you?
WAYNE: I’ve had training-
DUCARD: The training is nothing. The will
to take control is everything. Your
father trusted his city, its
logic... he thought he understood
the attacker and could simply give
him what he wanted...
Wayne considers this... breathing slowing... CALMER... they
separate.
DUCARD (CONT’D): (gently)
Your father did not understand the
forces of decay- cities like Gotham
are in their death throes- chaotic,
grotesque. Beyond saving.
WAYNE: Beyond saving? You believe that?
Ducard regards the harshly beautiful landscape.
DUCARD: It is not right that one must come
so far to see the world as it is
meant to be. Purity. Serenity...
Solitude. These are the qualities
we hold dear. But the important
thing is whether you believe it...
Wayne stares at Ducard.
DUCARD (CONT’D): Can Gotham can be saved, or is she
an ailing ancestor whose time has
run?
Ducard STRIKES DOWN at Wayne with his sword. Wayne BLOCKS
the strike with FOREARMS CROSSED, SLIDES BETWEEN DUCARD’S
LEGS across the ice to where his sword lies.
GRASPING his sword he SPINS, SWEEPING at Ducard’s feet.
Ducard LEAPS- Wayne CATCHES his foot, brings him down onto
the ice. Wayne THRUSTS his sword at Ducard’s throat-
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 20.
STOPS INCHES from Ducard’s bare neck. Ducard freezes, arms
at his sides. Wayne looks down at Ducard, SMILING in
triumph.
WAYNE: Yield.
Ducard smiles. Shakes his head.
DUCARD: You haven’t beaten me. You’ve
sacrificed sure footing for a
killing stroke.
Ducard TAPS the ice beneath Wayne’s feet with his sword- the
ice gives way, PLUNGING Wayne through the surface.

EXT. SHORE, FROZEN LAKE -- EVENING

Ducard feeds a small FIRE. Wayne RUBS his arms, SHIVERING
violently against hypothermia. Ducard looks at him.
DUCARD: Don’t rub your arms, rub your
chest. Your arms’ll take care of
themselves.
Wayne rubs his torso, NODS at Ducard. Ducard feeds the fire.
DUCARD (CONT’D): You have strength born of years of
grief and anger, Wayne. The
strength of a man denied revenge.
Even in his shivering, Wayne REACTS to this.
DUCARD (CONT’D): Why, Wayne..?

INT. WAYNE STATION PLATFORM -- DAY (WAYNE’S MEMORY)

A monorail pulls into the platform. Disgorges passengers.
DUCARD (V.O.): Why could you not avenge your
parents?
Amongst them, Bruce, AGED 20, holding a bag. He sees Alfred,
now 62, craning his neck, SEARCHING. He waves.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 21.
BRUCE: You didn’t have to pick me up-
ALFRED: Well, sir, the red line... well,
it’s closed. Apparently Mr.Earle
thought it wasn’t making enough
money.

INT. CONCOURSE, WAYNE STATION -- MOMENTS LATER

Bruce looks sadly at the DECAY to his father’s station: glass CRACKED, marble chipped, HOMELESS bundled in shuttered
storefronts... He looks up through the sparing glass: WAYNE
TOWER looms overhead, gold lettering catching the sun...
BRUCE: How is Mr.Earle?
ALFRED: Oh... successful.

INT. ROLLS ROYCE -- LATER

Alfred glances at Bruce in the rear-view mirror.
ALFRED: Will you be heading back to
Princeton tomorrow or could I
persuade you to spend an extra
night or two?
BRUCE: I’m not heading back at all.
ALFRED: You don’t like it there?
Bruce smiles, sardonic. Looks out at the trees flashing by.
BRUCE: I like it fine... they just don’t
feel the same way.
Alfred purses his lips, IRRITATED.
22.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Bruce STARES up at house. Alfred pulls the bag out of the
car and, to Bruce’s surprise, DROPS it at Bruce’s feet.

INT. WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

Alfred leads Bruce up the main staircase. The house is now
dark and empty. Dust-cloths cover much of the furniture.
ALFRED: (tense)
I’ve prepared the master bedroom.
BRUCE: My old room will be fine.
ALFRED: (stern)
With all due respect, sir, your
father is dead. Wayne Manor is your
house.
BRUCE: (irritated)
No, Alfred, his isn’t my house.
(gestures)
It’s a mausoleum. A reminder of
everything I lost. And when I have
my way I’ll pull the damn thing
down brick by brick-
Alfred turns on Bruce, angry.
ALFRED: This house, Master Wayne, has
sheltered six generations of the
Wayne family, and stood patiently
by while you’ve cavorted in and out
of a dozen private schools and
colleges. As have I.
Bruce stares at Alfred. Eyes burning. Chastened.
ALFRED (CONT’D): (softer)
The Wayne family legacy is not so
easily shrugged off.
BRUCE: (sadly)
Nor borne, old friend. I’m sorry to
have disappointed you.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 23.
ALFRED: Master Wayne... I was at your
father’s side when you were born.
And at your side when he was laid
to rest.
BRUCE: (voice catching)
I know.
ALFRED: Your father was a great man. But I
have every confidence that you will
exceed his greatness.
BRUCE: Haven’t given up on me, yet?
ALFRED: (conviction)
Never.
Bruce sags under the burden of Alfred’s faith. He opens the
door to his bedroom, then turns back to Alfred...
BRUCE: I may not get another chance to
thank you for all you’ve done for
me.
Alfred looks at him, curious.
ALFRED: Are you going away after the
hearing?
Bruce shrugs, hard to read. Then enters his old bedroom.

INT. BRUCE’S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Bruce puts his bag on the bed. Looks around the room.
At the mantel, Bruce stares at a framed photograph: Young
Bruce on his Dad’s shoulders, arms raised in triumph. Bruce
wipes dust from the photograph. Smiles at it.
INSERT CUT: Young bruce on Thomas’s shoulders- Thomas TIPS
back, threatening to drop Young Bruce who LAUGHS and LAUGHS.
Bruce moves to the bed. Opens his case.
Inside it is a GUN.
24.

EXT. GATES, WAYNE MANOR -- MORNING

Rachel, now 23, stands by her car looking up at the house.
She can see Bruce in the window. She gives a small wave.

INT. BRUCE’S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Bruce returns Rachel’s wave. Then FINISHES LOADING HIS GUN.

EXT. GATES, WAYNE MANOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Bruce walks down the drive to Rachel. He smiles gently.
BRUCE: You look well. "Assistant District
Attorney", right?
RACHEL: (nods, smiles)
You still trying to get kicked out
of the entire ivy league?
BRUCE: (shakes head, smiling)
Turns out you don’t actually need a
degree to do the international
playboy thing.
Rachel smiles. Looks down at her shoes. Then back to Bruce.
RACHEL: Bruce, I don’t suppose there’s any
way I can convince you not to come-
BRUCE: (cold)
Someone at this proceeding should
stand for my parents.
RACHEL: Bruce, we all loved your parents.
What Chill did is unforgivable-
BRUCE: Then why is your boss letting him
go?
RACHEL: Because in prison he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone. He learned
things and he’ll testify in
exchange for early parole.
25.
Bruce shakes his head, opens the car door. Rachel sighs.

INT./EXT. RACHEL’S CAR ON FREEWAY, GOTHAM -- MORNING

Rachel’s car heads towards the golden spires of Gotham.
Bruce stares out the window in silence.

INT. RACHEL’S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

Rachel pulls into the PARKING LOT of the COURTHOUSE. Parks.
Bruce looks at her through the strained silence.
BRUCE: Rachel, this man killed my parents.
I cannot let that pass.
Rachel almost says something. Then SHRUGS.
BRUCE (CONT’D): Rachel, I need you to understand.
Rachel looks at Bruce. Considering. Gently NODS. Bruce nods
back. Rachel opens her door and starts getting out.
Bruce slips out his GUN, placing it on the ground behind the
front wheel of Rachel’s car as he gets out.

INT. COURTHOUSE -- DAY

A small bureaucratic proceeding. A five person PANEL. Bruce
sits amongst the OBSERVERS. Watching the back of Chili’s
head. Rachel’s boss, FINCH, addresses the panel.
FINCH: Given the exemplary prison record
of Mr.Chill, the 14 years already
served and his extraordinary level
of cooperation with one of this
office’s most important
investigations... we strongly
endorse Mr.Chill’s petition for
early release.
The CHAIRMAN nods, consults his paperwork.
CHAIRMAN: I gather a member of the Wayne
family is here today...
Chill REACTS, TURNING. Bruce STUDIES his weathered face.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 26.
CHAIRMAN (CONT’D): ...does he have anything to say?
Chill notices Wayne’s cold eyes. Has to look away. Bruce
RISES, walks out, all eyes on him. Including Rachel’s.

EXT. PARKING LOT, COURTHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Bruce MOVES to Rachel’s car. Picks up his GUN, stuffs it up
the sleeve of his overcoat. Waits.
The side exit opens and two COPS come out. A shout goes up
from the pressmen around the front of the courthouse.
REPORTERS: They’re taking him out the side!!
REPORTERS swarm around the building as Chill emerges.
REPORTER1: Chill, any words for the Wayne
family?!!
Chill, head down, presses on. Bruce straightens. Breathes.
Starts WALKING towards Chill. A Reporter SPOTS him.
REPORTER2: It’s Bruce Wayne!
The Reporters clear a path, eager for a confrontation.
BLONDE FEMALE REPORTER: Joe! Hey Joe!!
This one catches Chill’s eye- blonde, local t.v. type.
Bruce’s hand DROPS to his side as he MOVES... he’s BREATHING
HARD... THINKING... DECIDING...: BLONDE FEMALE REPORTER (CONT’D)
Falcone says hi!!
She THRUSTS a gun at Chill’s chest and FIRES. Chill DROPS-
Bruce STOPS in his tracks. Reporters DIVE for cover- COPS
jump on the Blonde Reporter, pinning her...
Bruce. Fifteen feet away. Loaded gun up his sleeve. Face as
uncomprehending as the night Chill killed his parents.
Rachel moves to Bruce, pulling him away from the chaos.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 27.
RACHEL: Come one, Bruce. Come on, we don’t
need to see this.
Bruce yanks his arm away.
BRUCE: I do.

INT. RACHEL’S CAR -- EVENING

Rachel drives. Bruce sits there, hands in his lap. Staring.
Rachel glances over at him. Then pulls over. Turns to him.
RACHEL: (gentle)
Are you okay?
BRUCE: (distant)
All these years I wanted to kill
him. Now he’s gone. Now I can’t.
RACHEL: You don’t mean that.
BRUCE: (bitter)
What if I do, Rachel? Chill killed
my parents. They deserved justice.
Rachel looks at him, appalled.
RACHEL: You’re not talking about justice,
you’re talking about revenge.
BRUCE: Sometimes they’re the same.
RACHEL: They’re never the same, Bruce.
Justice is about harmony... revenge
is about you making yourself feel
better. That’s why we have an
impartial system-
Rachel pulls out into the street.
BRUCE: Well, your system of justice is
broken-
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 28.
RACHEL: Don’t you tell me the system’s
broken, Bruce! I’m out here every
day trying to fix it while you mope
around using your grief as an
excuse to do nothing. You care
about justice..?
Rachel YANKS the wheel-

EXT. FREEWAY, GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel’s car SCREECHES across two lanes, onto an EXIT RAMP.

INT./EXT. RACHEL’S CAR ON SURFACE STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

The streets below are DARK, crowded and THREATENING-
RACHEL: Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.
Rachel gestures at the filthy streets. Down dark alleys-
shadowy figures conduct business.
RACHEL (CONT’D): This city is rotting. Chill is not
the cause, he’s the effect.
Corruption is killing Gotham and
Chill being dead doesn’t help that-
it makes it worse because Falcone
walks. He carries on flooding our
city with crime and drugs...
creating new Joe Chills... Falcone
may not have killed your parents,
Bruce, but he’s destroying
everything they stood for...
They pull up in front of a BASEMENT CLUB.
RACHEL (CONT’D): They all know where to find
Falcone...
(gestures at club)
But no one will touch him because
he keeps the bad people rich and
the good people scared.
Rachel turns on Bruce.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 29.
RACHEL (CONT’D): (quiet)
And what chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?
She pokes him in the chest. Bruce looks down at her finger.
BRUCE: I’m not one of your "good people",
Rachel. Chill took that from me.
Rachel looks at Bruce strangely.
RACHEL: What do you mean?
Bruce pulls up his sleeve. Turns his hand over. Rachel
stares at the GUN in his hand, SHOCKED.
BRUCE: I was going to kill him myself.
She looks at Bruce. Then SLAPS him. Bruce does nothing.
Rachel SLAPS him again and again... Nothing. She stops.
Tears flowing.
RACHEL: You’re no better than the rest.
Rachel points at the gun. Looks into Bruce’s eyes.
RACHEL (CONT’D): Your father would be ashamed of
you.
Bruce stares at Rachel. Opens his door.

EXT. DOCK AREA, GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

Bruce watches Rachel’s car disappear. Turns to look at the
line of SHIPS in the harbor. He makes his way to the water.
Takes out his gun. Turns it, STUDIES the light off its
metal-
INSERT CUT: the TREMBLING BARREL of Chill’s gun, inches from
Thomas Wayne’s chest.
Bruce, with contempt, FLINGS his gun into the black water.
30.

EXT. BASEMENT CLUB, FACING DOCKS -- LATER

Bruce walks towards the entrance. A BOUNCER steps out,
looking at him with contempt.
BOUNCER: Get lost, kid.
Bruce pulls a massive wad of cash from his pocket. Splits it
in two. Offers one half.
BRUCE: The other half when you give me the
nod that Falcone’s leaving.
Unawares.
The Bouncer looks at Bruce. Takes the money.

EXT. BASEMENT CLUB, FACING DOCKS -- LATER

Bruce watches the entrance from the shadows. Two THUGS
escort a thickset man out of a club. The Bouncer waves-
BOUNCER: ’Night, Mr.Falcone.
The three men move towards a waiting limo-
WHAM- one Thug takes a kick to the head, goes down- Bruce
steps from the shadows- the Second Thug goes for his gun-
Bruce GRABS his arm- CHOPS his throat- JUDO FLIPS the
thug...
Bruce turns to Falcone who looks at him, curious.
FALCONE: The little rich kid. No gun? I’m
insulted.
The First Thug lunges at Bruce with a KNIFE- Bruce puts him
down with a graceful SWEEP-
BRUCE: I don’t need a gun.
FALCONE: Yes, you do.
CLICK. A gun is at Bruce’s head. Held by the Bouncer.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 31.
FALCONE (CONT’D): Money isn’t power down here- fear
is.
The Bouncer pistol whips him once, hard. Bruce goes down.
The Bouncer drops Bruce’s money onto him.
FALCONE (CONT’D): You shoulda just sent me a
thank-you note...
Bruce looks up at Falcone. Spits blood.
BRUCE: I didn’t come here to thank-you. I
came to show you that not everyone
in Gotham is afraid of you.
FALCONE: (laughs)
Just those that know me. You got
balls, kid...
(cold)
But you don’t belong down here with
us. We don’t play fair. Now go back
to your big house, wrap yourself in
your silk sheets and I’ll send you
a shoulder to cry on.
BRUCE: You don’t dress well enough to be a
pimp.
Falcone lights a cigar. Stares down at bruce. Ice.
FALCONE: You miss your Mommy and Daddy? Come
down here again, I send you to
them.
Falcone turns. His thugs get into the limo with him. Bruce
watches it slide into the night. Struggles to his feet...
Bruce walks the docks, wiping blood from his mouth. SHADOWS
in doorways mark his progress. Three YOUTHS approach. Bruce
stiffens, but they cross the street to avoid him.
MALE VOICE (O.S.): No one’ll mess with ya.
Bruce turns. A HOMELESS MAN warming at a flaming oil drum.
One of many HOMELESS clustered around the docks.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 32.
HOMELESS MAN: Wander ’round here dressed like
that, means you got something to
prove. Man with something to prove
is dangerous.
Bruce STARES at the man. Thinking. Takes out his wallet.
Removes the money. Hands it to the Homeless Man.
HOMELESS MAN (CONT’D): For what?
BRUCE: Your jacket.
Bruce DROPS his wallet into the fire. The Homeless Man
LAUGHS. Bruce pulls off his tie, throws it into the fire. He
pulls off his overcoat, bundles it up ready to-
HOMELESS MAN: Lemme have it, that’s a good coat.
Bruce looks at the Homeless Man, who has removed his own.
They EXCHANGE clothing.
BRUCE: Be careful who sees you with that.
(off look)
They’re gonna come looking for me.
HOMELESS MAN: Who?
Bruce smiles.
BRUCE: Everyone.
Bruce, less incongruous in his "new" coat, moves down
towards the stacks of containers...
Bruce wanders the stacks. A HORN sounds. Bruce’s eyes lock
onto the ship preparing to leave. Bruce runs towards it
trough the shadows...
DUCARD (O.S.): And when you left Gotham...
And we are-
33.

EXT. HIMALAYAN MONASTERY -- DAY

DUCARD: ...what were you seeking?
Ducard LEAPS up onto a STONE WALL. GRABBING ON using pikes
on his palms and on his feet. Wayne watches.
WAYNE: To lose myself. I couldn’t do
anything as Bruce Wayne. I felt
useless.
Ducard gestures up to the top of the 50-ft wall.
DUCARD: Perhaps you can beat my record.
Bruce JUMPS up onto the wall, HIGHER than Ducard. Confident.
WAYNE: How long?
DUCARD: Two days.
(off look)
The test is not to see how quickly
you can climb, but how slowly. The
Ninja is thought invisible, but
invisibility is largely a matter of
patience.
Ducard reaches up for another handhold. Slowly.
DUCARD (CONT’D): On your journey... you sought
knowledge of the criminal world?
WAYNE: (nods)
I needed to understand the thoughts
and feelings of those who stand in
the shadows...
CUT TO::

EXT. CROWDED MARKET, AFRICAN PORT TOWN -- EVENING (MEMORY)54

WAYNE (V.O.): The first time you’re forced to
steal not to starve...
34.
Bruce picks up a mango from a stack to examine it. As he
does so he uses his lower hand to slip a PLUM into his
pocket.

EXT. ALLEY, AFRICAN PORT TOWN -- LATER

Bruce squats in a doorway. Bites hungrily into his plum. He
looks up. A CHILD in rags sits in the next doorway, STARING.
Bruce stares back, juice dripping.
WAYNE (V.O.): ...you lose many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and
wrong.
Bruce hands the Child the plum. Licks his fingers. Hard.

INT. TRAIN STATION, LONDON -- DAY

Bruce (bearded, filthy) in a crowd, with an ELDERLY MAN.
WAYNE (V.O.): I needed to feel the fear before a
crime...
The Elderly Man SPOTS a BUSINESSMAN hurrying along- STEPS
into his path, engineering a COLLISION, tumbling to the
pavement. The Businessman and Bruce both CROUCH to help.
WAYNE (V.O.) (CONT’D): And the thrill of success...
Bruce SLIPS the Businessman’s wallet out of his pocket. The
Businessman moves off. Bruce shows the Elderly Man the
wallet for APPROVAL. Then HURRIES after the Businessman.
WAYNE (V.O.) (CONT’D): ...without becoming one of them.
Bruce CATCHES the Businessman, gives him the wallet. The
Businessman thanks Bruce- noticing his destitution, he HANDS
Bruce a banknote. Bruce nods thanks.
31.
35.

INT. WAREHOUSE, UNDER THE ARCHES, EASTERN EUROPE -- NIGHT 57

Bruce tries to crack a safe under the supervision of a YOUNG
TOUGH. The Young Tough shakes his head, spins the dial and
whips open the safe. Showing Wayne the action.
WAYNE (V.O.): I thought I would find something...

INT. SMOKE-FILLED BACKROOM, SHANGHAI -- NIGHT

At a table with a CHINESE BOSS and SEVEN CRIMINALS drinking,
laughing, showing each other their spoils (watches, phones).
WAYNE (V.O.): I thought I would learn what I
needed to do with my skills and my
anger...

INT. WAREHOUSE, SHANGHAI -- DAY

A TRUCK races through the door. Two Criminals yank the doors
shut after. Bruce and the Boss jumps down from the cab.
WAYNE: But the harder I looked the less I
saw. The less I knew...
Bruce turns to the Boss wary.
BRUCE: Where’s this friend of yours?
BOSS: (shrugs)
Not friend. Friend of friend.
Bruce rolls his eyes. Looks at the Boss with contempt.
WAYNE (V.O.): Until I wasn’t even sure what I’d
been looking for in the first
place...
The doors EXPLODE COPS burst in, shouting in Mandarin.
36.

INT. SAME -- LATER

The back of the truck is opened. Cops inventory piles of
BOXES pulled out of the back.
WAYNE (V.O.): And I was lost.
Bruce sits in a line of criminals, hands cuffed behind back.
A Cop YANKS him to his feet, hauling him over to an OFFICER.
COP: (in Mandarin)
He refuses to give his name.
The Officer smiles solicitously at Bruce.
OFFICER: (in Mandarin)
Fool- this is China, you’re a
criminal, what the hell do I care
what your name is?
BRUCE: (in fluent Mandarin)
I’m not a criminal.
The Officer, surprised, waves Bruce away. Looks at the
truck.
OFFICER: (in accented English)
Tell that to the guys who owned
these!
He KICKS a BOX: CLOSE ON the WAYNE INDUSTRIES logo.
CUT TO::

EXT. WALL, HIMALAYAN MONASTERY -- DAWN

Wayne and Ducard cling to the wall just short of the roof,
eyes LOCKED. Both are in AGONY, sweat-drenched, STRAINING.
Ducard BLINKS. REACHES for the roof and pulls himself up.
Wayne closes his eyes in relief. Ducard pulls Wayne up onto
the roof. They lie there in the half-light. Ducard turns to
Wayne. Puts a hand on his shoulder. Proud.
DUCARD: You are ready.
37.

INT. THRONE ROOM -- NIGHT

Close on Wayne’s BLUE POPPY- now SHRIVELED DRY- on the
altar. Wayne, clad in black ninja uniform watches as Ducard,
also in black, picks it up, takes a pestle and mortar, drops
in the dried flower, and grinds it to dust.
Ducard pours the dust into a small brazier. Lights it.
Motions to Wayne, who approaches the smoking altar.
DUCARD: Drink in your fears. Face them.
Wayne breathes the smoke. He shakes his head, REACTING to
the effects of the smoke... his mind is plagued by IMAGES: Chill’s trembling gun- Young Bruce FALLING- Thomas
STAGGERING-: Ducard puts on his ninja mask. Motions Wayne to do the same.
Wayne STRUGGLES to think through the effects of the smoke...
WAYNE: Why The masks?
As if in reply, DOZENS of NINJAS step forward from the
shadows: the hall is filled with identical Ninjas. Ducard
has melted into the crowd. Wayne raises his guard...
DUCARD: To conquer fear, you must become
fear... you must bask in the fear
of other men... and men fear most
what they cannot see-
Ducard STRIKES at Wayne- Wayne SPINS, PARRIES- but Ducard
has gone. The Ninjas movie in unison, forming WALLS...
DUCARD (CONT’D): It is not enough to be a man... you
have to become an idea... a
terrible thought... a wraith-
The Ninja nearest Wayne TURNS and SLASHES- it is Ducard.
Wayne LEAPS sideways, ROLLING through the wall of Ninjas. He
looks at his arm- it has been slashed, the uniform torn a
dead giveaway. Wayne looks around, crouched, READY...
One wall of Ninjas PARTS, revealing a WOODEN BOX. Wayne
stares at it, MIND SPINNING from the smoke.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 38.
DUCARD (O.S.): Face your fear...
Wayne cautiously approaches the box. Carefully lifts the
lid. PEERS inside...
BATS EXPLODE from the box, FILLING the air- Wayne dives away
from the box, STARING up at the squawking bats- flinching...
Ducard LEAPS at Wayne, who ROLLS sideways, blocking- Wayne
turns to face Ducard, but he is lost in the Ninjas, bats
filling the air, Wayne FLINCHING with their attacks...
Wayne stays low, SLASHES the arm of the Ninja nearest him-
the man does not move. Wayne turns. Fighting to THINK.
A Ninja paces softly through the crowd, as he speaks, we can
tell this is Ducard...
DUCARD: Become one with the darkness...
Ducard falls in behinds a Ninja with a SLASHED SLEEVE... He
KNOCKS him to his knees, sword against throat-
DUCARD (CONT’D): You cannot leave any sign...
Ducard pulls off his own mask. Disappointed.
WAYNE (O.S.): I haven’t.
A SWORD IS AT DUCARD’S NECK- Wayne is behind him, pulling
off his mask. Ducard looks around... several of the Ninjas
around them have slashed sleeves. Ducard smiles.
The Ninjas TURN, in unison, and sit.
Ra’s Al Ghul is seated on a small stage at the head of the
room. Ducard leads Wayne to sit down in front of Ra’s. A
Ninja places a tray between them: a bottle and a burning
candle. Ducard places the candle in front of Wayne and hands
him a small glass. Ra’s Al Ghul begins speaking in Urdu.
DUCARD: We have purged your fear. You are
ready to lead these men. You are
ready to become a member of the
League of Shadows. Drink.
Wayne tips back the glass. Strong stuff.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 39.
DUCARD (CONT’D): By blowing out this candle you
renounce your mortal life. You
renounce forever the cities of man.
You dedicate your life to solitude.
Wayne leans forward to blow out the candle. PAUSES. Looks at
the rows of seated Ninjas.
WAYNE: Where will I be leading these men?
DUCARD: You will need them in Gotham.
WAYNE: You want me to go back to Gotham?
Ra’s stares at Wayne. Starts speaking...
DUCARD: You yourself are a victim of
Gotham’s decay. That is why you
came here, and that is why you must
go back. You will assume the mantle
of your birthright. As Gotham’s
favored son you will be ideally
placed...
WAYNE: For what?
DUCARD: To help us destroy the city.
WAYNE: What?!
DUCARD: When Gotham falls, the other cities
will follow in short order.
Nature’s balance will be restored
and Man will finally return to
solitude.
Wayne turns to Ducard.
WAYNE: You can’t believe in this.
Ducard looks at Wayne, troubled.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (4): 40.
DUCARD: Ra’s Al Ghul has rescued you from
the darkest corner of your own
heart... what he asks in return is
obedience. And the courage to do
what is necessary.
Wayne stares down at the flickering candle. At the bottle.
Wayne FLICKS his sword out, SMASHING the bottle, TIPPING the
candle- FLAMES spread across the wooden floor-
DUCARD (CONT’D): (reaching to extinguish
flames)
What are you doing?
WAYNE: What’s necessary.
Wayne STRIKES Ducard in the head with the butt of his sword,
DOUSES his mask in the liquid fire and TOSSES it back into
the mezzanine where the explosive powders are stored...
Ra’s LEAPS from his throne, STRIKING at Wayne with his
sword- Wayne parries- EXPLOSIONS roar from the balcony,
shooting flame across the ceiling- Ra’s and Wayne fight as
EXPLOSIONS surround them...
Wayne LEAPS clear as FLAMING DEBRIS collapses onto Ra’s,
CRUSHING him... the flames are rising, Ninja bodies are
strewn around, fresh explosions rip across the hall as
Ninjas flee and Wayne spots Ducard lying unconscious.
Wayne PICKS UP Ducard, hauls him out of the Throne room,
into a passage, SMASHING THROUGH an ornate screen...

EXT. MOUNTAINS -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne and Ducard CRASH down onto a steep slope of ice and
rock, the monastery exploding above them... Wayne rolls
over, GRABS a rock, looks across to see-
Ducard UNCONSCIOUS, SLIDING down the icy slope. His limp
form ROTATES, spinning as his body gathers MOMENTUM, rushing
towards the EDGE of the CLIFF...
Wayne DIVES AFTER HIM, SLIDING HEAD-FIRST down the ice...
the cliff closer and closer as Wayne RACES after Ducard...
41.
MERE FEET FROM THE CLIFF EDGE, Wayne GRABS Ducard- raises
his free GAUNTLET-CLAD ARM, and SMASHES AT THE ICE, DIGGING
IN with the BRONZE SCALLOPS... STOPPING on the edge- Ducard
HANGS LIMPLY over a tremendous drop- Wayne STRUGGLES with
the dead weight. Wayne PULLS Ducard up onto the ice.
BREATHING.:

EXT. TINY HAMLET, HIMALAYAS -- DAY

Wayne CARRIES Ducard down the road.

INT. SHERPA’S HUT -- MOMENTS LATER

Wayne KICKS the door open. The Old Man he saw on his way up
the mountain stares back at him. Then motions Wayne to put
Ducard down onto some mats. The Old Man wipes blood from
Ducard’s temple. Looks at Wayne, who is moving to the
door...
OLD MAN: I will tell him you saved his life.
Wayne stops. Turns. Looks back at Ducard.
WAYNE: Tell him... I have an ailing
ancestor who needs me.
Wayne puts his hands together in formal salute. Bows.

INT. CLIMBER’S BAR, BHUTAN -- DAY

A smoky inn, full of SHERPAS and CLIMBERS. Wayne enters,
FILTHY, RAGGED. Conversation CEASES. Everyone STARES.

INT. SAME -- MOMENTS LATER

Wayne uses a phone at the bar, waiting for an answer-
ALFRED (O.S.): Wayne residence.
Wayne SMILES at Alfred’s familiar voice.
WAYNE: (hoarse)
Alfred.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 42.
ALFRED: (unflappable)
Master Wayne. It’s been some time.
WAYNE: Yes. Yes it has. I need a ride.
ALFRED: And where are we, sir?
Wayne glances around.
WAYNE: Bhutan, I think.
A curious Sherpa nearby NODS at Wayne.
ALFRED: Am I to assume that you’re without
money and passport?
WAYNE: I’m traveling a bit light, yes.
ALFRED: I believe there’s an airstrip at
Khatmandu long enough for a G5.
Make your way there, I’ll have the
jet down in fifteen hours.
WAYNE: Very good. Oh, and Alfred?
ALFRED: Yes, sir?
WAYNE: Bring some painkillers.

INT. PRIVATE JET -- DAWN

Wayne steps out of the washroom, clean-shaven, fresh
tailored clothes. The jet breaks cloud, revealing GOTHAM
bathed in glorious SUNRISE. Wayne looks out at the city.
Alfred, sleeping opposite, opens an eye.
WAYNE: Have you told anyone I’m coming
home?
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 43.
ALFRED: I thought you might like to
surprise a few people.
WAYNE: No one can know I’m back. Not until
I’m ready. I’ll need everything on
the company- shareholders’ reports,
holdings. Everything.
Alfred SMILES to himself. Closes his eyes again.
ALFRED: You sound like a man with purpose.
Wayne stares at the vast city beneath them as the jet BANKS.
WAYNE: Gotham needs me, Alfred. Gotham
needs... a symbol.
ALFRED: What symbol, sir?
WAYNE: I’m not sure. Something for the
good to rally behind...

EXT. GOTHAM -- SUNRISE

MOVING over SPIRES of the city catching GOLD of first light.
WAYNE (V.O.): ...and the criminals to fear.

INT. LIBRARY, WAYNE MANOR -- NIGHT

Wayne, cross-legged on the floor, STUDIES a thick report.
Circles something, closes it. Draws another from a STACK.

INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE MANOR -- EVENING

Alfred makes tea. A television plays: business news.
INTERVIEWER: (over television)
Lot of interest in new directions
Wayne Industries has been taking...
Alfred looks up: Earle is being interviewed.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 44.
INTERVIEWER (CONT’D): ...couple big defense contracts in
the bag... as well as rumors that
the board is petitioning to have
Bruce Wayne, missing for seven
years now, declared officially
dead.
EARLE: (smiles thinly)
Our operating assumption is always
the hopeful one that Bruce’ll
resurface sometime soon.

INT. LIBRARY, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne HEARS a CHITTERING. He rises, moving out into the main
hall...

INT. MAIN HALL, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne STARES: a small shadow SPUTTERS around the ceiling...
ALFRED (O.S.): A blessed bat gain, sir.
Wayne turns to find Alfred standing there with a tea
service.
ALFRED: They nest somewhere on the grounds.
Wayne watches the dark shape FLICKER around the ceiling.

EXT. GROUNDS, WAYNE MANOR -- DAY

Wayne walks across the gardens to the greenhouse. He wears a
long overcoat, a coil of rope over one arm.

INT. GREENHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Now derelict. Glass cracked or missing, paint peeled from
wrought iron. Wayne stands in the entrance, remembering-
INSERT CUT: Rachel, LAUGHING, SPRINTING between the tables.
45.

INT. DISUSED WELL SHAFT -- MOMENTS LATER

DARKNESS, punctured by LIGHT as BOARDS are YANKED,
splintering from the mouth of the well, high above.
Wayne LOWERS himself down the shaft, overcoat billowing. He
undoes his rope at the bottom. TURNS, finding-
The DARK CREVICE between the rocks. Wayne CROUCHES, pushing
into the BLACKNESS, crawling through into-

INT. CAVERNS -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne climbs down a jagged rock crevice. Air blows in his
face. The crevice WIDENS into a low-ceilinged chamber. Wayne
hears the RUSH of WATER. He crouches, advances through the
low chamber. It turns DOWNWARDS, steeper- Wayne carefully
slides on his back, LOWERING HIMSELF into...
LIMITLESS BLACK. Wayne stands. A ROAR of water now. He
REACHES into his coat, pulls out a CHEMICAL TORCH. CRACKS
it, throwing LIGHT into...
A VAST CAVERN. An underground RIVER, a JAGGED ceiling, far
above, which, as Wayne PEERS, starts to MOVE-
BATS EXPLODE from the ceiling. THOUSANDS DESCEND,
SCREECHING, attracted to the light- Wayne instinctively
CROUCHES. But as they SWARM around him terrifyingly...
Wayne RISES to his feet amidst a CYCLONE of bats, watching
the fluttering blackness with a profound CALM.
And he knows the symbol he must use.

INT./EXT. ROLLS ROYCE ON GOTHAM STREETS -- MORNING

Wayne stares at the DECAY. Sadness gives way to anger.

EXT. WAYNE PLAZA -- LATER

The Rolls pulls up onto the Plaza in front of Wayne Station.
The station is deserted. Derelict. Wayne gets out, staring.
WAYNE: Is it closed?
ALFRED: They still run a token service out
of respect for your father.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 46.
WAYNE: (low)
Respect?

INT. BOARD ROOM, WAYNE TOWER -- CONTINUOUS

A board meeting in full swing. Earle presiding. He is
addressing a portly, distinguished man at the other end.
This is JUDGE PHELAN.
EARLE: Clearly, Judge Phelan, moving to
have Bruce declared dead is not
something that any of us here
relishes... but as responsible
managers it falls to us to act on
behalf of Wayne Industries...

INT. OUTER OFFICE, WAYNE TOWER -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne walks past the young, beautiful ASSISTANT sat her
desk.
WAYNE: Morning.
The Assistant gets to her feet.
ASSISTANT: Sir, you can’t go in there!
Wayne turns to her. Smiles.
WAYNE: Yes, I can.
The Assistant RECOGNIZES him, stands there, SHOCKED.

INT. BOARD ROOM, WAYNE TOWER -- CONTINUOUS

As the door OPENS, Earle looks over, annoyed.
EARLE: I’m sorry, can I...?
Earle STARES. Dumbstruck. All heads TURN- Wayne smiles.
WAYNE: Sorry to barge in, but I was in the
areas...
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 47.
SILENCE. Earle gets to his feet, approaching Wayne, STARING.
He SHAKES Wayne’s hand, claps the other on his shoulder.
EARLE: My boy! We thought you were gone
for good.
WAYNE: What can I say? "Reports of my
death have been greatly
exaggerated".
Nervous chuckles. Judge Phelan stares at Wayne, incredulous.
EARLE: Can I ask where you’ve been?
WAYNE: (mischievous)
You can ask...
EARLE: (smiles)
Well, perhaps you’ll tell us your
plans. Are you back to finish
college?
WAYNE: Actually, I thought I’d get to
grips with what we actually do
around here. From the ground up-
one division at a time.
Earle takes this in, nodding.
EARLE: Any idea where you’d like to start?
WAYNE: Applied sciences caught my eye.
EARLE: Mr.Fox’s department. I’ll make a
call. You can start today.
WAYNE: Actually, I’ve got a one o’clock
tee-off, and it took me all morning
to convince the club to honor my
old membership.
(grins at Earle)
Apparently they don’t have to meet
the same high standards as you when
it comes to declaring someone dead.
48.

INT. STAIRCASE, DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE -- DAY

Rachel HURRIES down marble stairs to catch Finch.
RACHEL: Mr.Finch.
FINCH: (weary)
Yes, Miss Dodson?
RACHEL: Mr.Finch, on the Falcone matter-
FINCH: (here we go again)
The case against Falcone died with
Chill. We had our shot.
They walk out into the parking lot...

EXT. PARKING LOT, COURTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

RACHEL: That was then- but now he’s
importing drugs, everybody knows
it, let’s take it to Harvey Dent
and-
FINCH: (looking around)
Keep your voice down.
(quite, sympathetic)
Look, Rachel, Falcone’s got Judge
Phelan and half of City Hall bought
and paid for. So you got burned on
Falcone- let it go, we’ve got
bigger fish to fry.
RACHEL: That would make a lot more sense if
we were doing any frying.
Finch, uncomfortable, TURNS. Rachel WATCHES him exit...

INT. ROLLS ROYCE -- CONTINUOUS

In the back seat, Wayne WATCHES Rachel standing there.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 49.
ALFRED: Shall I park, sir?
Wayne wrestles for a moment...
WAYNE: No, let’s go.
Alfred pulls out with a touch of disappointment.

INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- DAY

A massive WAREHOUSE, stacked with crates, odd-shaped under
dust covers, lab equipment. LUCIUS FOX, aged 52, leads Wayne
through the stacks, speaking in calm, knowledgeable tones.
FOX: Environmental applications, defense
projects, consumer products... all
prototypes, none if production at
any level whatsoever.
WAYNE: None?
Fox pauses, turns to Wayne, a wicked gleam in his eye.
FOX: What did they tell you this place
was?
WAYNE: They didn’t tell me anything.
FOX: They told me exactly what it was
when they sent me here... a dead
end where I couldn’t cause any more
trouble for the rest of the board.
WAYNE: You were on the board?
FOX: Back when your father ran things.
WAYNE: You knew my father?
FOX: Sure. Helped him build his train.
Beautiful project- routed right
(MORE):
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 50.
FOX (CONT’D): into Wayne Tower, along with the
water and power utilities. Made
Wayne Tower the unofficial heart of
Gotham.
Fox stops at a tall CRATE. Checks paperwork. Opens the
crate: a BODYSUIT- clear silicone over jointed armor.
FOX (CONT’D): Here it is: the nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry. Kevlar
biweave, reinforced joints...
Wayne feels the fabric of the suit.
WAYNE: Bullet-proof?
FOX: Anything but a straight shot.
WAYNE: Tear-resistant?
Fox HACKS at the suit with his pen- it doesn’t even mark.
FOX: This sucker’ll stop a knife.
WAYNE: Why didn’t they put it into
production?
FOX: The bean counters figured a
soldier’s life wasn’t worth the 300
grand.
Fox looks at Wayne. Suspicious.
FOX (CONT’D): What do you want with it, Mr.Wayne?
WAYNE: I want to borrow it. For
spelunking.
(off look)
You know, cave-diving.
Fox shrugs. Puts the lid back on the crate.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 51.
FOX: You get a lot of gunfire down in
those caves?
WAYNE: (smiles)
Listen, I’d rather Mr.Earle didn’t
know about me borrowing-
FOX: Mr.Wayne, the way I see it...
Fox waves his arm, taking in the enormous facility.
FOX (CONT’D): All this stuff is yours, anyway.

INT. CAVERNS BENEATH WAYNE MANOR -- DAY

Wayne, high on the cavern wall, in climbing harness, HAMMERS
a bracket into the rock securing a line of industrial LAMPS.
WAYNE: Okay! Give it a try.
Alfred throws a switch on a portable GENERATOR: the lamps
flicker on, dimly lighting the length of one wall. Alfred
peers at the DAMP, DINGY surroundings.
ALFRED: Oh, charming.
Alfred sees the BATS covering the entire ceiling.
ALFRED (CONT’D): At least you’ll have company.
Wayne RAPPELS to the cave floor, looks up to a HIGH corner: CRUMBLING BRICKWORK. Alfred follows his gaze.
ALFRED (CONT’D): Must be the lowest foundations of
the Southeast wing.
Wayne CLIMBS up: poking through the rock ceiling: the bottom
of a wrought-iron SPIRAL STAIRCASE. In the center of the
spiral: a dumb-waiter lift, fallen off its track. Wayne
grabs the chains of the lift, RATTLES them- sending a wave
ECHOING up into the darkness.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 52.
ALFRED (CONT’D): During the civil war your
greatgrandfather was involved with
the underground railroad. Secretly
transporting freed slaves to the
North. I suspect these caverns came
in handy.
Wayne jumps down. Moves to the small river. Follows it where
it disappears under rocks. Steps over. Alfred waits. The
ROAR of WATER gets louder and the light gets BRIGHTER. Wayne
follows the tunnel around a dog leg, emerging...
BEHIND THE FACE OF A WATERFALL. Wayne grins, HOPS along
slick rocks right up to the beautiful CURTAIN of water.
WAYNE: (awe)
Alfred, come up here.
Alfred is twenty feet behind on the dry rocks.
ALFRED: I can see it very well from here,
thank-you, sir.
Wayne, mesmerized, reaches for water that is liquid light.

INT. UNMARKED POLICE SEDAN -- EVENING

Gordon, now 46 and a Detective, in the passenger seat. Worn
eyes watching his partner, FLASS, 42, glad-hand the owner of
the liquor store they are parked outside. Flass squeezes
into the driving seat holding a wad of CASH.
FLASS: Don’t s’pose you want a taste?
Gordon looks at Flass, cold. Flass shrugs. Counts his money.
FLASS (CONT’D): I keep offering ’cause who knows,
maybe one day you’ll get wise.
GORDON: Nothing wise in what you do, Flass.
FLASS: Yeah? Well, Jimbo, you don’t take
your taste- makes us guys nervous
you might decide to roll over-
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 53.
GORDON: (irritated)
I’m no rat, Flass.
(calmer)
In a town this bent, who’s there to
rat to, anyway?
Flass LAUGHS at this, hits the gas.

EXT. ROOFTOPS, GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

Moving in on a rooftop balustrade to discover Wayne, wearing
the bodysuit, crouched, watching the police station across
the street. He pulls on a black balaclava. CLIMBS through
the SHADOWS using Ninja SPIRES on his hands and feet.

EXT. POLICE STATION -- MOMENTS LATER

Gordon slams the car door. Watches Flass pull away. Weary.

INT. GORDON’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon SLUMPS into his chair, back to the window. Reaches
for the phone- notices a BOOK sitting on his desk: an old,
worn copy of: "PHYLUM PERACOPDA: THE TWILIGHT WORLD OF
BATS".: Gordon frowns at the book, CONFUSED. The light goes OUT.
WAYNE (O.S.): Don’t turn around.
Gordon FREEZES- Wayne is behind his, pressing a stapler
between Gordon’s shoulder blades as if it were a gun.
GORDON: What do you want?
WAYNE: I’ve been watching. You’re a good
cop. One of the few. What would it
take to get Falcone?
Gordon narrows his eyes, puzzled.
GORDON: Carmine Falcone?
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 54.
WAYNE: He brings in shipments of drugs
every week, nobody takes him down.
Why?
GORDON: He’s paid up with the right people.
WAYNE: What would it take?
GORDON: Leverage on Judge Phelan. And a
D.A. brave enough to prosecute.
WAYNE: Rachel Dodson in the D.A.’s office.
GORDON: Who are you?
WAYNE: Watch for a sign.
GORDON: You’re just one man?
WAYNE: Now we are two.
GORDON: We?
No response. Gordon turns around. No one. He JUMPS to the
window- looks down, looks up: a SHADOW slips onto the roof-

INT. BULLPEN -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon RACES across the bullpen, drawing his gun, hits the
stairwell- two UNIFORMS see him go, run after him.

EXT. ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne moves to the edge of the roof- the gap is TOO BIG- he
TURNS BACK- the DOOR SMASHES open: Gordon GUN RAISED.
GORDON:
FREEZE!: Wayne RACES for the GAP- LEAPS... DROPS FAST... misses THE
TOP STORY- GRABS the balcony below... it BREAKS AWAY- DROPS
him onto the one below. Winded, Wayne CLIMBS onto the wall.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 55.
From the other roof, Gordon watches Wayne melt into the
shadows. The Uniforms arrive either side.
UNIFORM 1: The hell was that?
GORDON: (dismissive)
Some nut.
But Gordon’s expression is less certain.

INT. EARLE’S OFFICE, WAYNE TOWER -- DAY

Earle sits at his desk conferring with two board members.
BOARD MEMBER: Is he taking over?
EARLE: Not yet. I checked the trust, and
Bruce can’t assume control until
his thirtieth birthday.
(presses intercom)
Jessica, where’s that coffee?
BOARD MEMBER: But that’s in three months.
EARLE: We’ll have to move fast.
BOARD MEMBER 2: To do what?
EARLE: An IPO. There’s nothing in Bruce’s
trust to stop us taking the company
public... we’ll have an offering...
BOARD MEMBER: (getting it)
And Bruce will become just another
board member.
EARLE: Precisely. We can’t have some clown
prince running things.
(presses intercom)
Jessica?
No answer. Earle steps to the door and opens it. His
assistant is GONE. So is the receptionist.
56.

EXT. ROOFTOP, WAYNE TOWER -- MOMENTS LATER

The SWISH-CLICK of a Titleist rocketing off the roof and out
towards Gotham River. Wayne stands behind the Beautiful
Assistant, hand on her hip, adjusting her grip on a gold
club. Another YOUNG WOMAN watches, leaning on a driver.
WAYNE: Keep your elbows in...
EARLE (O.S.): Ladies?
They turn. Earle is standing there.
JESSICA: Sorry, Mr.Earle, Mr.Wayne insisted
that all junior executives need to
know how to play golf.
EARLE: Junior Executive? Who’s answering
the phones?
Wayne smiles pleasantly at Earle.
WAYNE: This is Wayne Industries, Mr.Earle-
I’m sure they’ll call back.
Wayne unwraps himself from Jessica and approaches Earle.
WAYNE (CONT’D): (conspiratorial)
I thought a few promotions might be
good karma forgetting my new job.
Earle smiles patiently.
EARLE: Of course, you’re not actually
starting just yet, Bruce. Not until
your birthday.
WAYNE: (grins)
Three month’s time- I’m having a
huge blowout and I expect everyone
to be there.
EARLE: With bells on. How are things down
at Applied Sciences?
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 57.
WAYNE: Great- there’s some cool stuff down
there. Although that Mr.Fox goes on
a bit once you get him talking.
Earle takes Wayne by the elbow, walking him away.
EARLE: Since you’re here, there is a
business matter that I wanted to
make you aware of...
Wayne assumes a pose of seriousness.
WAYNE: Business... sure.
EARLE: We’ve been thinking for some time
about offering shares... I think
the time is right.
WAYNE: Offering shares?
EARLE: It’s just a way of raising capital
for growth... it’s important to me
that the company be in great shape
when you take over. Consider it my
legacy.
Wayne nods.
EARLE (CONT’D): Well, I guess I’d better go hire a
new secretary and receptionist...
Earle head to the door. Wayne smiles, turns back to Jessica.
WAYNE: Right, who’s turn is it?

EXT. FALCONE’S BASEMENT CLUB, DOCK AREA -- NIGHT

Judge Phelan exits the club, a GIRL on his arm.
BOUNCER: Night, Judge Phelan.
Phelan turns, giddy with drink, puts his finger to his lips.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 58.
PHELAN: Shhhhh.
The Girl giggles. Phelan guides her into a waiting limo. A
STREET PERSON comes over to the rear windows of the car,
knocking. The DRIVER gets out.
DRIVER: Get lost!
The Driver KICKS the Street Person away from the limo. A
Homeless Man warming by a fire starts shouting. It is the
Homeless Man that Bruce gave his coat to years before. The
coat is worn but recognizable.
HOMELESS MAN: Leave him alone! Let him be!
The limo moves off. Close on the Street Person watching it
leave. IT IS BRUCE. He glances down at a tiny CAMERA in his
lap. Smiles at the screen: Phelan and the Girl.

INT. BAT CAVE -- DAY

Wayne places two BRONZE GAUNTLETS on a trestle table. FIRES
up a paint sprayer. Starts coating them matte BLACK.

INT. SAME -- LATER

Wayne is showing Alfred DIAGRAMS. We catch only GLIMPSES.
ALFRED: If we order the main part of
this...
(points)
...cowl from Singapore-
WAYNE: Via a shell corporation.
ALFRED: Indeed. Then quite separately,
place an order through a Chinese
manufacturer for these-
Alfred points at a diagram which looks like a pair of HORNS.
WAYNE: (nods)
Put it together ourselves.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 59.
ALFRED: Precisely. Of course, they’ll have
to be large orders to avoid
suspicion.
WAYNE: How large?
ALFRED: Say, ten thousand.
WAYNE: (smiles)
Least we’ll have spares.

INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- MORNING

Fox, at his desk, watches Wayne approaching.
FOX: (smiles)
What’s it today? More "spelunking"?
WAYNE: Sper-lunking. And no, today it’s
base-jumping.
FOX: Base-jumping? What, like
parachuting?
WAYNE: I need some kind of lightweight
grappling hook...
FOX: For what?
WAYNE: Base jumping’s illegal-you can’t
just take the elevator.
Fox shakes his head at Wayne. Gets to his feet. They sit.
FOX: We’ve got suction pads, grapples...
WAYNE: Any good?
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 60.
FOX: Nope. But this thing’s pretty neat.
Fox pulls out a box. Inside: a bronze GRAPPLING GUN and
HARNESS.:
FOX (CONT’D): Pneumatic. Magnetic grapple.
Monofilament tested to 350 pounds.
Wayne feels the weight. It is light. Strong. He picks up the
HARNESS that goes with it. Shoulder straps with a wide,
hi-tech BELT. Wayne shoves the back end of the gun into the
belt buckle- it CLICKS into place.
WAYNE: Too expensive for the army?
Fox takes it back from Wayne. Sardonic.
FOX: Guess they never thought about
marketing to the billionaire
base-jumping, spelunking market.
WAYNE: Look, Mr.Fox, if you’re
uncomfortable-
FOX: Mr.Wayne, if you don’t tell me what
you’re really doing, then when I
get asked... I don’t have to lie.
But don’t treat me like an idiot.
WAYNE: (nods)
Fair enough.
Fox looks at Wayne. Thinking.
FOX: Come on, I’ll show you something.

INT. LOADING DOCK, APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- LATER

Fox hands Wayne a sheet of black fabric.
FOX: Notice anything?
Wayne examines it, shrugs. Fox puts on a GLOVE.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 61.
FOX (CONT’D): Memory fabric- dual layer polymers
with variable alignment molecules.
Flexible ordinarily, but put a
current through it...
Fox GRABS the fabric- which instantly POPS into the RIGID
shape of a small one-man TENT. Wayne raises his eyebrows.
FOX (CONT’D): ...the molecules align and become
rigid. Wayne pushes on the tent,
feeling its strength, fascinated.
WAYNE: What kind of shapes can you make? Fox releases the tent,
which instantly COLLAPSES.
FOX: It could be tailored to any
structure based on a rigid
skeleton.
Wayne lifts the black fabric, FLICKING it in a WHIPPING
motion. Thinking. Then he sees something. Some kind of
vehicle, covered by a tarp. HUGE TIRES visible.
WAYNE: What’s that?
Fox, a twinkle in his eye, rolls up the memory fabric.
FOX: The Tumbler? Oh, you wouldn’t be
interested in that.
Wayne shoots Fox a look, and we
CUT TO:: P.O.V.: RACING ALONG, INCHES ABOVE A TEST TRACKINT. TUMBLER
ON TEST TRACK -- MOMENTS LATER
Wayne pilots using aircraft-like control sticks. Fox, in the
passenger seat, hangs on as Wayne PUSHES the vehicle...
The Tumbler SHOOTS PAST: LOW and WIDE, a cross between a
Lamborghini Countach and a Humvee. Sandy camouflage,
stealthangled panelling and variable-angle flaps across the
back.
Fox SHOUTS over the noise of the engine.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 62.
FOX: She was built as a bridging
vehicle!
You hit that button-
(Wayne reaches)
NO, NOT NOW!!: (Wayne recoils)
It boosts her into a rampless jump!
In combat, two of them jump a river
towing cables, then you run a
bailey bridge across! Damn bridge
never worked- but this baby works
fine!
Wayne inspects the cockpit: a forward-slung "gunner’s"
driving position between their legs, video screens,
electronic controls, windows with HEADS-UP DISPLAY. Wayne
ACCELERATES...: The Tumbler TEARS down the straightaway, SKIDS to a HALT.

INT. TUMBLER -- CONTINUOUS

Fox JOLTS with the stop. Turns to Wayne, a little green.
FOX: What do you think?
Wayne turns to Fox with a slight smile.
WAYNE: Does it come in black?

INT. BAT CAVE -- DAY

Wayne takes the hi-tech harness for the grapple and CUTS OFF
the shoulder straps, leaving a BELT WITH SLIDING
ATTACHMENTS.:

INT. SAME -- LATER

Wayne lifts a GLOVED hand, metal contacts on the fingertips.
With his other hand, he picks up a FABRIC GLOVE, RIBBONS
dangling from each finger. He thrusts the gloved hand into
the fabric glove- the ribbons SHOOT OUT- RIGID FINGER
EXTENSIONS like the SKELETON of a BAT’S WING. Wayne FANS the
PROJECTIONS, testing.
63.

INT. BAT CAVE -- LATER

Close on: the COWL. Black, with a slight GRAPHITE sheen.
Dramatic, ICONIC even without its ears.
A BASEBALL BAT SMASHES into the crown, CRACKING it in two.
Alfred picks the pieces off the table, FROWNING.
ALFRED: Problems with the graphite mixture,
apparently. The next ten thousand
will be up to specifications.
Wayne looks up from adjusting a servo-mounted microphone.
WAYNE: At least they gave us a discount.
ALFRED: Quite. In the meantime, might I
suggest, sir, that you try to avoid
landing on your head?
Wayne shoots Alfred a look. Then fits the microphone into
the horn-shaped "ear" from the cowl.

INT. SAME -- LATER

Wayne GRINDS METAL at a lathe. Alfred approaches with a
thermos. Wayne stops grinding, BLOWS on his handiwork...
ALFRED: Why the design, Master Wayne?
Alfred indicates the steel carved into a BAT’S WING.
WAYNE: A man, however strong, however
skilled, is just flesh and blood. I
need to be more than a man. I need
to be a symbol.
ALFRED: And why the symbol of the bat?
WAYNE: Bats frighten me.
(slight smile)
And it’s time my enemies shared my
dread.
Wayne tilts the crude BATARANG, watching light dance across
the brushed steel. He THROWS it WHISTLING into darkness...
64.

INT. FALCONE’S CLUB, DOCK AREA -- NIGHT

Judge Phelan sits sandwiched between two GIRLS, drink and
cigar in hand. He looks up.
PHELAN: Carmine! Where are you going?
Falcone is putting his coat on.
FALCONE: Duty calls. You have yourself a
good time, Judge.
Falcone turns to the CLUB MANAGER. Leans in.
FALCONE (CONT’D): If he’s too cheap to get a hotel,
at least make him take his car
around to the alley.
(shakes his head)
No class.

EXT. DOCKS -- CONTINUOUS

Down in the stacks, THUGS unload BOXES an open container.
HEADLIGHTS light them up- everyone FREEZES. A sedan pulls
up. FLASS emerges. Approaches one of the thugs holding a
box. OPENS it, YANKS out a STUFFED TOY.
FLASS: Cute.
Flass RIPS open the toy, pulls a plastic PACKAGE from
inside.
FLASS (CONT’D): (mock surprise)
Oh? What have we here?
Nobody reacts. Flass hands the toy back to the Thug.
FLASS (CONT’D): Carry on, gents.
Flass heads inside a massive warehouse to a set of offices.
65.

INT. OFFICE, DOCKS -- CONTINUOUS

Flass enters. Falcone sits at the desk.
FALCONE: You believe this hump, Flass?
He indicates a thin man opposite. Flass sits.
FLASS: Problem?
FALCONE: Crane here’s making insinuations.
The thin man, CRANE, leans forward. A cold presence.
CRANE: Insinuations? Well, let me be
clearer- you stepped on the last
shipment before you delivered it to
me. You cut it with baby powder,
and rendered it useless for my
purposes. Falcone stares at the
slight man, incredulous.
FALCONE: (furious)
Flass, tell this guy what happens
to people who talk to me this way.

EXT. FALCONE’S CLUB, DOCK AREA -- CONTINUOUS

Judge Phelan stumbles out of the club with the GIRLS. They
pile into the waiting limo. The Club Manager gestures to the
Driver to pull around into the alley.

EXT. ALLEY, DOCK AREA -- CONTINUOUS

The Limo idles in the alley.

INT. LIMO -- CONTINUOUS

The Driver picks his ear. The partition is closed. The
Driver examines his finger...
WHAM!!! A BLACK SHAPE LANDS ON THE HOOD- the Driver’s eyes
go wide as-
SMASH!!!- a BLACK-GLOVED FIST SHATTERS THE WINDSCREEN and
GRABS the Driver’s neck...
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 66.
IN THE BACK: Phelan sits BOLT UPRIGHT. The girls look
around, ALARMED.
THE PARTITION SLOWLY LOWERS, REVEALING:
BATMAN.: Crouched like a dark animal on the hood- the Girls SCREAM.

EXT. ALLEY -- CONTINUOUS

The Homeless Man looks up from his brazier, curious. He sees
a dark shape on the hood of a limo, a LONG BLACK CLOAK
BILLOWING out behind it... screams echo through the alley...

INT. LIMO -- CONTINUOUS

Phelan scrambles back in his seat, whimpering...
BATMAN: You have eaten well... As Gotham
has starved.
Batman’s eyes stare out of the black cowl at Phelan.
BATMAN (CONT’D): This changes tonight.
Batman SHOOTS UP OFF the hood, banging onto the roof-

EXT. ALLEY -- CONTINUOUS

The Homeless Man STARES OPEN-MOUTHED at Batman standing,
ICONIC, on the roof of the limo, cloak billowing... Batman
turns his head towards the Homeless Man-
BATMAN: Nice coat.
-and FLIES UP from the limo, DISAPPEARING into the shadows
high above...
The Homeless Man looks down at his coat, then back up to the
shadows...
HOMELESS MAN: (small)
Thanks.
67.

INT. OFFICE, DOCKS -- CONTINUOUS

Crane looks at Falcone, matter-of-fact.
CRANE: I’m aware that you’re not
intimidated by me, Mr.Falcone. But
you know who we’re working for...
and when he gets here I don’t think
he’s going to want to hear that
you’ve been endangering our
operation just to filch a few
dollars from your dealers.
FALCONE: He’s coming to Gotham?
CRANE: Soon. This is our last shipment.
Falcone shifts, SUDDENLY UNEASY.

EXT. THE STACKS -- CONTINUOUS

A THUG hands a box to a SECOND THUG, who walks away along
the corridor of containers. The first Thug turns back to the
darkness of the open container, reaches in-
HE IS YANKED INTO THE DARKNESS WITH AN ECHOING CRY-
Second Thug TURNS, stares uneasily down the deserved
corridor to the BLACK MOUTH of the open container...
SECOND THUG: Steiss?
No reply. He puts down his box. Draws his gun. A THIRD THUG
comes around the corner.
THIRD THUG: Come on, we gotta-
He sees the Second Thug’s gun. Draws his own. They move
cautiously towards the open container...

EXT. THE STACKS -- CONTINUOUS

The Thugs peer into the blackness of the open container-
68.
Behind them, a LAMP hanging above the corridor SHATTERS, the
Thugs turn, startled, to see another lamp shatter and go
dark- them another and another, DARKNESS ADVANCING TOWARDS
THEM...:

INT. OFFICE, DOCKS -- CONTINUOUS

Falcone lifts his hands in a gesture of peace.
FALCONE: There’s no need to argue- you can
just test the stuff here and now.
CRANE: That’s why I came.
Flass tosses the package onto the desk.

EXT. THE STACKS -- CONTINUOUS

As the closest lamp SHATTERS, a GLINT of metal DROPS to the
ground... the Second Thug bends, picks it up, STARING;
A BAT-SHAPED brushed steel plate. The Second Thug looks up,
confused, but the Third Thug is STARING above him.
SECOND THUG: What?
The Second Thug looks up himself: a DARK SHAPE HANGING from
a CRANE directly above him...
A GIANT BAT, WINGS FOLDED, head pointed towards the ground.
SECOND THUG (CONT’D): What the hell-
The Bat DROPS- wings WHIP OUT, RIGID- CATCH the air-
FLIPPING the shape downwards- ENVELOPING THE SECOND THUG IN
DARKNESS- the Third Thug BOLTS, RACING between containers,
arms PUMPING-
He SPRINTS headlong down the narrow corridor, SKIDS around a
corner, RACES towards-
BLACKNESS SIDESWIPES THE THIRD THUG, SPINNING HIM OFF HIS
FEET, WHIPPING HIM INTO DARKNESS WITH A PIERCING SCREAM...
69.

Other Thugs REACT to the SCREAM...

Falcone and Crane hear the scream. Flass JUMPS up.

EXT. THE STACKS -- CONTINUOUS

Thugs, guns drawn, advance into the stacks...

EXT. THE STACKS -- CONTINUOUS

A Fourth Thug WHIPS around a corner to see a JUMPY THUG
covering the other end of the corridor...
The Fourth Thug nods, steps backwards. MOVEMENT in the
shadow behind him... BATMAN IS ALREADY IN FRAME- his arm
FLASHES forward with his CLOAK, WRAPS the Thug’s neck, YANKS
him backwards into the shadows...
Jumpy Thug sees the other Thug DISAPPEAR... he OPENS FIRE,
STROBING the stacks, revealing INDISTINCT GLIMPSES of
MOVEMENT.: ELSEWHERE IN THE STACKS: Thugs REACT to the gunfire...
Flass stands outside the stacks, gun drawn, listening. He
moves back into the office.

INT. OFFICE, DOCKS -- CONTINUOUS

FALCONE: What the hell’s going on?!
Flass looks at Falcone.
FLASS: You’ve got a problem out there.
Falcone reaches behind the desk, PULLS out a SHOTGUN.
70.

EXT. THE STACKS -- CONTINUOUS

Jumpy Thug FIRES blindly at STROBING SHADOWS- GLIMPSES of a
DARK CLOAKED FIGURE moving from SHADOW TO SHADOW. Jumpy Thug
empties the clip. FUMBLES for another as he looks out into
the darkness.
JUMPY THUG:
WHERE ARE YOU?!!!: A whispered word at his ear:
BATMAN: Here.
BATMAN’S FACE, UPSIDE DOWN, at the Thug’s shoulder- Jumpy
Thug SCREAMS as he is ENGULFED by DARKNESS-

EXT. OUTSIDE THE STACKS -- CONTINUOUS

Flass scuttles over to his car. Crane pauses, listening to
the shouts and gunfire. Then moves off into the night.

EXT. THE STACKS -- CONTINUOUS

Falcone advances through the stacks, shotgun in hand. He
rounds a corner to find FIVE THUGS, various weapons in hand,
in a loose defensive ring, peering out into the darkness...
A SHADOW DROPS into the center of their ring-
Thugs TURN, SHOUTING, one SWINGS a CHAIN, another a KNIFE-
-Batman DUCKS the chain- SWEEP-KICKS the knife-wielder to
the ground. Chain SWINGS again...
Batman JUMPS up, one leg LOW to let the CHAIN WRAP around
his ANKLE- Batman KICKS his leg sideways RIPPING the chain
from its owner, then HEAD BUTTING him down -
Batman SPINS his CHAIN-WRAPPED LEG in a ROUNDHOUSE KICK,
WHIPPING THREE THUGS behind him in the fade with the CHAIN.
All three go DOWN. The rest are unconscious or gone.
Batman STANDS there, long cape BILLOWING out to one side.
The chain SLIDES from his leg. Falcone is behind him,
SHOTGUN aimed dead at Batman’s head.
FALCONE: What in God’s name are you?
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 71.
Batman opens his hand, revealing TWO SHOTGUN CARTRIDGES.
Then TURNS, billowing cape WRAPPING around him.
BATMAN: I’m Batman.
Falcone pulls the trigger. CLICK.

INT. BEDROOM, RACHEL’S APARTMENT -- LATER

Rachel TOSSES, trying to sleep, eyes shut.
VOICE (O.S.): Rachel Dodson.
Rachel bolts upright, GRASPING at her bedside table.
RACHEL: Who’s there?!!
She pulls out a TASER- PEERS into the shadows: Silhouetted
by the window- a dark, cloaked figure. Batman.
RACHEL (CONT’D): Take one step, I drop you!
Batman moves his arm- something DROPS onto Rachel’s bed: a
FILE, spilling PHOTOS. She FLINCHES. GLANCES DOWN: photos of
Phelan and the girl in the limo.
RACHEL (CONT’D): What the hell is this?
BATMAN: Leverage.
RACHEL: What do I need leverage for?
BATMAN: To get things moving.
RACHEL: Who are you?
BATMAN: Someone like you. Someone who’ll
stand against the corruption.
Rachel reaches for the lamp, her eyes off the window for the
INSTANT it takes to ILLUMINATE the room, revealing-
No one.
72.

EXT. DOCKS -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon approaches, coffee in hand: TIED-UP THUGS sit against
the container full of DRUGS. UNIFORMS hold back a line of
PRESS, who snap away at the surreal scene. Gordon crouches
to look at the Thugs, curious.
UNIFORMED COP (O.S.): Falcone’s men?
GORDON: (shrugs)
Does it matter? We’ll never tie him
to it, anyway.
UNIFORMED COP (O.S.): I wouldn’t be too sure of that.
Gordon looks up. The uniformed Cop is POINTING. At a HARBOR
LIGHT trained on the heavens. Gordon RISES, walks towards
it. Two Cops stand there, STARING: Falcone is STRAPPED to the LIGHT, UNCONSCIOUS, arms spread.
Coat RIPPED, hanging from his arms in a STRANGE PATTERN.
COP 1: Th hell is that? Looks like...
Gordon follows their gaze up to where the BEAM of light CATS
FALCONE’S SHADOW onto the CLOUDS.
COP 2: Like a bat.
Gordon stares at the projection. It is a BAT SYMBOL.
GORDON: Cut him down.
Gordon moves away, THINKING. Something catches his eye: a
block away. Halfway up a building. A BLACK FLAG blowing in
the wind... Not a flag.. a DARK FIGURE, wearing a CAPE,
sitting on a LEDGE... BATMAN. WATCHING.

INT. FINCH’S OFFICE -- MORNING

Rachel TOSSES a newspaper onto Finch’s desk, BEAMING. The
front page: a huge photo of Falcone strapped to the light.
RACHEL: No way to bury it now.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 73.
FINCH: Maybe so, but there’s Judge Phelan-
RACHEL: I’ve got Phelan covered.
FINCH: And this "bat" they’re babbling
about.
Rachel breaks eye contact for an instant, UNCOMFORTABLE.
RACHEL: Even if these guys’ll swear in
court to being thrashed by a giant
bat... we have Falcone at the
scene- drugs, prints, cargo
manifest- everything.
Finch considers. Grins.
FINCH: Damn right. Let’s get frying.

INT. BULLPEN, POLICE HEADQUARTERS -- MORNING

Loeb addresses CAPTAINS, SERGEANTS, LIEUTENANTS. Gordon at
the back. Loeb HOLDS up the PAPER, SMACKS the front page.
LOEB: Unacceptable. I don’t care if it’s
rival gangs, Guardian Angels or the
goddamn Salvation Army- get them
off the street, and off the front
page.
CAPTAIN SIMPSON: They say it was one guy... or
thing.
LOEB: Dipping into their own supply- it
was some asshole in a costume.
(the room chuckles)
If it’s one guy, that’ll make it a
lot easier for you, won’t it?
Gordon RAISES his hand. Loeb NODS, cautious.
GORDON: This guy did deliver us one of the
city’s biggest crime lords.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 74.
LOEB: (glares)
No one takes the law into their own
hands in my city, understand?

INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE MANOR -- DAY

Alfred opens the curtains. Wayne WAKES, squinting.
WAYNE: (groggy)
Bats are nocturnal.
ALFRED: Bats, maybe... but even for
billionaire playboys, 3 o’clock is
pushing it. The price of leading a
double life, I fear.
Alfred PUTS down a tray: water, fruit, newspaper.
ALFRED (CONT’D): Your theatrics made an impression.
WAYNE: Theatricality and deception are
powerful weapons, Alfred. It’s a
start.
Wayne glances at the paper. Gets out of bed, bare-chested.
Alfred sees BRUISES across his torso and arms.
ALFRED: If those are to be the first of
many injuries... it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse. Polo,
for instance.
Wayne throws Alfred a look.
WAYNE: I’m not learning polo, Alfred.
ALFRED: Strange injuries, a nonexistent
social life... these things beg the
question of what, exactly, Bruce
Wayne does with his time. And his
money.
Wayne considers this.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 75.
WAYNE: What does someone like me do?
ALFRED: (shrugs)
Drive sports cars, date movie
stars... Buy things that aren’t for
sale.
Wayne looks at Alfred. Nods. DOWNS the water, stands
straight, feet together- FALLS FORWARD to the floor- into
his dizzyingly fast push-ups. Alfred watches. Concerned.
ALFRED (CONT’D): Who knows, Master Wayne- if you
start pretending to have fun, you
might even have a little by
accident.

INT. COUNTY JAIL, RECEIVING -- DAY

Crane, briefcase in hand, is BUZZED through thick steel and
glass doors and met inside by a PRISON OFFICIAL. They walk.
PRISON OFFICIAL: Dr.Crane, thanks for coming down...
CRANE: Not at all. So he cut his wrists?
PRISON OFFICIAL: Probably looking for an insanity
plea, but if anything happened...
CRANE: Of course, better safe than sorry.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM, COUNTY JAIL -- CONTINUOUS

Crane enters. Falcone sits at a table, wrist bandaged. Crane
places his briefcase on the table. Falcone smiles.
FALCONE: Doctor Crane, it’s all too much,
the walls are closing in, blah,
blah, blah. Couple more days of
this food, it’ll be true.
CRANE: What do you want?
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 76.
FALCONE: We got a lot to talk about.
CRANE: Such as?
FALCONE: Such as, how you’re gonna convince
me to keep my mouth shut.
CRANE: About what? You don’t know
anything.
FALCONE: I know you wouldn’t want the cops
taking a closer look at the drugs
they seized.
Crane REACTS to this. Falcone SMILES, enjoying the reaction.
FALCONE (CONT’D): I know about your experiments on
the inmates at your nuthouse...
(off look)
I don’t get into business with
someone without finding out their
dirty secrets. Those goons you
hired.. I own the muscle in this
town.
Falcone leans forward. Looks Crane in the eye.
FALCONE (CONT’D): So what have I been bringing in for
you hidden in my drugs, Crane?
CRANE: If he wanted you to know he’d have
told you himself.
Falcone shifts slightly.
FALCONE: I’ve been smuggling your stuff in
for months, so whatever he’s got
planned, it’s big. And I want it.
Crane studies Falcone. Considering. Sighs.
CRANE: I already know what he’ll say...
that we should kill you.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 77.
Falcone leans forward, glaring at Crane with contempt.
FALCONE: Even he can’t touch me in here. Not
in my town.
Crane SHRUGS. Leans forward. Pops the locks on his
briefcase. Smiles at Falcone.
Crane reaches into his briefcase. Inside is a BREATHING
APPARATUS attached to a small BURLAP SACK MASK.
CRANE: Would you like to see my mask?
He pulls the mask out of the case. Holds it up.
CRANE (CONT’D): I use it in my experiments.
Probably not very frightening to a
guy like you. But those crazies...
Falcone stares at Crane, uneasy. Crane puts on the mask. It
is a sack with eye holes and twine stitching for a mouth.
CRANE (CONT’D): ...they can’t stand it...
FALCONE: When did the nut take over the
asylum-
WHUMP- a cloud of white SMOKE shoots out of Crane’s
briefcase. Falcone pushes his chair back, COUGHING,
surprised.
CRANE: They scream and cry...
Falcone looks up at Crane in his mask-
Through Falcone’s eyes: tiny LIZARD TONGUES FLICK out of the
holes in Crane’s mask.
CRANE (CONT’D): ...much as you’re doing now.
Crane TOWERS over Falcone, FLAMING EYES and FLAMING MOUTH...
Falcone SCREAMS.
78.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INTERVIEW ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Crane emerges with his briefcase. The Prison Official hovers
outside. SCREAMS ECHO from inside the room.
CRANE: Oh, he’s not faking. Not that one.
The Prison Official nods gravely. Crane leans in.
CRANE (CONT’D): I’ll talk to the Judge, see if I
can get him moved to the secure
wing at Arkham. I can’t treat him
here.

EXT. ARCTIC OCEAN -- DAY

A COAST GUARD HELICOPTER touches down on the back of a
heavily damaged DESERTED CARGO SHIP. Two COAST GUARDSMEN
with FLASHLIGHTS jump onto the deck of the ship to take a
look around. BAFFLED. The deck is lined with HOLES.
The Coast Guardsman shines his light into a MASSIVE HOLE.

INT. EARLE’S OFFICE, WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- AFTERNOON

Earle is at his desk. A EXECUTIVE walks in, TROUBLED.
EXECUTIVE: We have a situation.
EARLE: What kind of situation?
EXECUTIVE: Coast guard picked up one of our
cargo ships last night. Heavily
damaged. Crew missing, probably
dead.
EARLE: What happened?
EXECUTIVE: Ship was carrying a prototype
weapon. A microwave emitter...
79.

EXT. AIRBASE -- MORNING (FLASHBACK)

ARMY BRASS and SCIENTISTS waiting for a demonstration... an
industrial MACHINE the size of a small van sits on the
ground a hundred feet from a WATER TOWER...
EXECUTIVE (V.O.): It’s designed for desert warfare-
it uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy’s water
supply...
The Scientists and Brass don goggles. Fire up the machine...
the water tower starts SHAKING... then EXPLODES in a CLOUD
OF STEAM that drifts towards the observers like FOG.

INT. EARLE’S OFFICE, WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- CONTINUOUS

EXECUTIVE: It looks like someone fired it up
at sea- judging from the damage to
the ship and cargo.
EARLE: What about the weapon?
The Executive shifts, uneasy.
EXECUTIVE: It’s missing.

EXT. HOTEL RESTAURANT, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- EVENING

A BUGATI VEYRON (looks, and costs, a million) pulls up to
the valet station. Wayne emerges, impeccably tailored, from
the driver side. The VALETS scramble to the passenger side.
Open the door to find TWO BLONDES, one on the other’s lap.

EXT. HOTEL RESTAURANT -- CONTINUOUS

Tables around a decorative infinity pool. Earle and his
GUESTS at a table. Earle sees Wayne enter with the Blondes.
He sighs. Then waves.
80.

EXT. SAME -- LATER

The table is littered with bottles and empty plates.
FEMALE GUEST: At least he’s getting something
done.
MALE GUEST: Bruce, help me out here.
Wayne turns from the Blondes. They stand up and walk over to
the pool. Wayne smiles, turns to the Female Guest.
WAYNE: A guy who dresses up like a bat
clearly has issues.
FEMALE GUEST: But he put Falcone behind bars-
MALE GUEST: And now the cops are trying to
bring him in, so what does that
tell you?
FEMALE GUEST: They’re jealous?
Wayne watches as, behind them, one of the Blondes slips off
her dress and lowers herself into the pool... the other one,
giggling, follows her lead.
WAYNE: If he’s so benevolent why does he
hide his face?
FEMALE GUEST: Maybe he’s protecting the people he
cares about from reprisals.
Wayne nods, considering. The MAITRE D’ slides up, annoyed.
MAITRE’ D: Sir, the pool is for decoration,
and your friends do not have swim
wear.
WAYNE: Well, they’re European.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 81.
MAITRE’ D: I’m going to have to ask you to
leave.
WAYNE: (turns to Earle)
Mr.Earle, I’m buying this hotel.
Will you please broker a deal?
Earle nods. Patiently.
WAYNE (CONT’D): (turns to Maitre D’)
I think we should make some new
rules for the pool area, don’t you?
The Maitre D’ stares at Wayne. Dumbstruck.
BLONDES (O.S.): Bruce!
The Blondes beckon Wayne. He comes to the edge of the pool.
WAYNE: Ladies?
They SPLASH him. Earle turns away, shaking his head. Behind
him, out of focus, Wayne is PULLED into the pool.

EXT. HOTEL -- LATER

Wayne and the Blondes, wet hair, in white HOTEL ROBES,
waiting. The Valet pulls up in the Bugati.
RACHEL (O.S.): Bruce?
Wayne turns. Rachel is standing there, dressed for dinner.
Stunning.
WAYNE: Rachel.
BLONDES: (from car)
Come on, Bruce. We have some more
hotels we want you to buy.
Rachel glances at the Blondes. Then back to Wayne.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 82.
RACHEL: I’d heard you were back.
(Wayne nods)
Where were you?
WAYNE: Oh, kind of all over, you know.
RACHEL: (tense)
No, Bruce, I don’t. And neither did
a lot of people. People who thought
you were probably dead.
WAYNE: You didn’t?
RACHEL: I never quite gave up on you.
Wayne looks at her. Thinking. Gestures towards the Bugati.
WAYNE: Rachel, all that... that’s not me,
inside I’m... different. I’m-
RACHEL: The same great little kid you used
to be? Bruce, deep down, your
friends out there are great, too.
It’s not who you are underneath...
(pokes his chest)
But what you do that defines you.
Rachel moves past him. Wayne stands there, eyes burning.

INT. GORDON’S APARTMENT -- EVENING

Gordon’s pregnant wife, BARBARA tries to get their TWO-YEAR
OLD to eat. Gordon KISSES her, picks up the trash.

EXT. BACK ALLEY, GORDON’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon sticks the lid on the trash can. THUNDER rolls
around.
FLASS (O.S.): Gonna rain, huh?
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 83.
GORDON: What do you want, Flass?
Flass, leaning on his car, feigns offence. Pulls a pint
bottle from his pocket.
FLASS: How’s Barbara? The kid?
Gordon takes a drag, eyeing Flass coldly.
FLASS (CONT’D): Another one on the way, right? Big
responsibility. And when you’re on
a big case like Falcone... lot of
time away from here.
GORDON: Cut to it, Flass.
FLASS: Just saying it’s good the case is
clear cut- you’ll wrap it up easy.
Flass finishes his bottle. Throws it at the trash cans.
GORDON: You come around here making
threats, pretending to be liquored
up... tells me you’re scared.
FLASS: (cold)
Take care of yourself, pal.
Gordon watches him head back to his car.
BATMAN (O.S.): Trouble?
Gordon looks up: Batman is crouched in the fire escape.
GORDON: (shrugs)
The scum’s getting jumpy because
you stood up to Falcone.
BATMAN: It’s a start. Your partner was at
the docks with Falcone.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 84.
GORDON: He moonlights as a low-level
enforcer.
BATMAN: There was another man. Testing the
drugs.
GORDON: (surprised)
It wasn’t a buy- why risk opening a
package on the docks?
BATMAN: Flass knows.
GORDON: He won’t talk.
BATMAN: He’ll talk to me.
Gordon looks up. Close on Batman, in the shadows.
GORDON: Commissioner Loeb set up a massive
task force to catch you. He thinks
you’re dangerous.
BATMAN: What do you think? Gordon gets to
his feet, dusts off his pants.
GORDON: I think you’re trying to help...
Gordon looks up. But Batman is gone.
GORDON (CONT’D): ...but I’ve been wrong before.

EXT. CARGO SHIP, DOCKS -- NIGHT

Three MEN walk through the canyons of shipping containers,
checking the tags with a flashlight. They stop at one.
CUSTOMS AGENT: This is the one I’m talking about.
DOCK EMPLOYEE 1: What’s your problem with it?
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 85.
CUSTOMS AGENT: It shouldn’t exist. This ship left
Singapore with 246 containers and
arrived with 247. Probably dead
illegals. You got a strong stomach?
They HAUL the doors open. The Customs Agent looks inside: an
industrial machine the size of a small van. His torch picks
out the WAYNE INDUSTRIES logo on the side.
CUSTOMS AGENT (CONT’D): What the hell is this thing?
BEHIND HIM: Dock Employee 1 raises a SILENCED GUN. FIRES.
Dock Employee 2 helps DRAG the body into the container.

EXT. FALAFEL STAND, SURFACE STREET -- NIGHT

Raining. Flass stuffs falafel into his mouth. Grabs a
banknote from the VENDOR. Flass walks down a dark street...
YANKED from the pavement, he’s PULLED up between buildings,
falafel falling, UP and UP until face-to-face with. The
Batman. Rain pouring off his cowl. Holding Flass by his
ankle. Flass is SCREAMING.
BATMAN: Who was with Falcone at the docks?
FLASS: I don’t know, I swear to God-
BATMAN: Swear to ME.
Batman DROPS Flass three flights down on the wire. PULLS
TAUT- WHIPS him back up.
FLASS: (terrified whispers)
I never knew his name... never...
Sometimes shipments went to this
guy before they went to the
dealers-
BATMAN: Why?
FLASS: There was something else in the
drugs, something hidden-
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 86.
BATMAN: What?
FLASS: I don’t know- something! I never
went to the drop-off- it’s in the
Narrows- cops can’t go into the
Narrows except in force...
BATMAN: Batman can.

EXT. THE NARROWS -- NIGHT

AN ISLAND IN GOTHAM RIVER: a ramshackle LABYRINTH of
crumbling public housing, makeshift additions GROWING LIKE
FUNGUS AROUND AN INSANE ASYLUM. A walled city. Slick with
rain.
Batman LANDS, CROUCHING, looking at the windows of a
WAREHOUSE built around the supports of the MONORAIL tracks.

EXT. WAREHOUSE, SHANGHAI -- MOMENTS LATER

Batman slips through a louver, drops SILENTLY to the floor
amidst. By the freight elevator is a massive shipping crate.
Batman leaps up onto its lid- pries it open.
Inside: the industrial machine the size of a small van.
Batman sees the WAYNE INDUSTRIES logo and a number:
M-EMIT.42B: NOISES. Batman melts into the shadows. THREE MEN enter. Two
are the Dock Employees. The third is Crane.
DOCK EMPLOYEE 1: The boss wants you to keep it in
the asylum until the time comes.
CRANE: Fine, leave the body. Torch the
place. No traces.
The Thugs pull the Customs Agent’s body out then push the
crate onto the elevator. Crane notices RAIN spattering off
the open louver. He steps towards it. Thug 2 turns from the
elevator holding a Molotov cocktail. LIGHTS it-
A cord WRAPS around the BOTTLE- YANKS it into the shadows.
Its fuse is EXTINGUISHED. The Thugs STARE at the darkness.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 87.
Batman RIPS from the shadows- Thug 1 pulls a gun- Batman
SMASHES his arm to the ground. Thug 2 moves in from the
side- is DROPPED by a fast elbow to the neck.
Batman turns to Crane- now wearing his MASK. Carne’s hand
FLASHES towards Batman, who DODGES a small puff of SMOKE.
Batman moves for Crane- COUGHS, CHOKES- losing BALANCE-
GASPING... Batman looks at Crane, sees a monster: FLAMING
EYES, ELONGATED LIMBS, SPINNING like a DERVISH...
Batmen REELS, in the throws of a hallucination. Crane
SMASHES the BOTTLE over him, soaking him with GASOLINE...
Batman LURCHES for the windows, IMAGES ASSAULTING his mind: INSERT CUT: BATS EXPLODE from the DARK CREVICE-
Batman TURNS to Crane. Who holds a FLAMING LIGHTER.
CRANE (CONT’D): Need a light?
Crane TOSSES the lighter at Batman... who BURSTS into
FLAMES.: INSERT CUT: Ra’s Al Ghul OPENS his BOX- BATS BURST FORTH-
Batman, IN FLAMES, SPINS- LEAPS desperately at the windows-

EXT. WAREHOUSE, THE NARROWS -- CONTINUOUS

Batman SMASHES through the window, CLOAK ABLAZE...
FALLING... tries to ACTIVATE his CLOAK- but only gets one
side to POP OPEN... the deployed wing causes him to SPIRAL-
INSERT CUT: Young Bruce FALLING, FALLING in the well shaft-
Batman PLUMMETS, trailing flame, UNOPENED WING FLUTTERING
with the violent FLAPPING of-
BATS: SCREECHING, FLAPPING, FLUTTERING DARKNESS...
Batman’s STIFF WING HOOKS a RAILING- SLOWS him with a
JOLTRIPS- DROPPING him to the ground with a CRASH...
Young Bruce HITS the dirt at the bottom of the SHAFT-
...and a SIZZLE, as wet pavement DAMPS the flames, GROANING,
Batman ROLLS his burning batsuit along the asphalt.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 88.
Batman, smoldering, LURCHES into an alley, raises his
grapnel gun, FIRES up at the enclosed roof- RIDES up-
PUNCHES his way through wire and metal, CRAWLS onto his
back, STARING up at the skyscrapers of Gotham. Rain blurring
his vision.
Insert cut: Young Bruce watches his Father CRUMPLE-
Batman FUMBLES at his belt. Pulls out a tiny phone.
BATMAN: (hoarse)
Alfred?! Alfred?!

INT. ROLLS -- LATER

Alfred DRIVES, looks through the rear-view mirror at Batman,
who lies in the back, FLINCHING at invisible antagonists.
BATMAN: BLOOD! Alfred?! Blood! A sample-
take a sa- sample- poisoned...
To Batman- the car is FILLED WITH BATS... Mefistofle
rises...
Young Bruce in the throws of his PANIC ATTACK GULPS AIR-
turns to his Father, LOOKS him in the eye and CONDEMNS HIM-
YOUNG BRUCE: (shouting)
We HAVE to go NOW, Dad!!
Young Bruce DRAGS his parents from their seats...

INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE MANOR -- MORNING

Wayne awakes. Shivering. Red-eyed from crying. Alfred sits
at his bedside, watching over him.
WAYNE: (hoarse)
How long did I sleep?
ALFRED: Two days. It’s your birthday.
WAYNE: It was some kind of gas... I only
breathed the slightest amount...
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 89.
ALFRED: I dread to think, sir, what
would’ve happened if you’d had a
lungful.
WAYNE: I’ve felt those effects before...
but this was much more potent.
ALFRED: I took a blood sample and sent it
to a laboratory known discreet both
discreet...
(hands Wayne paper)
...and prompt bloodwork.
BRUCE: (reading)
Protein-based compounds... might be
possible to work up an antidote.
ALFRED: Shall I contact Wayne
Pharmaceutical?
BRUCE: I’ve got a better idea.

INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- DAY

Fox looks over the toxicology report. Looks up at Wayne.
FOX: This was in your blood?
WAYNE: It’s some kind of weaponized
hallucinogen. Administered in
aerosol form.
FOX: Mr.Wayne, you are definitely
hanging out at the wrong clubs.
WAYNE: Could you synthesize an antidote?
FOX: Well, the hallucinatory compounds
can be balanced... but this
receptor’s a compound I’ve never
seen before.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 90.
WAYNE: (reaches for paper)
So you can’t.
FOX: (snatches it away)
Did I say that? I just want you to
know how hard it’s gonna be.
Fox puts the report on his desk.
WAYNE: Do you know what a Wayne Industries
M-Emit42B is?
FOX: No. But she will...
Fox starts typing on his computer.
FOX (CONT’D): Oh.
WAYNE: What?
FOX: It won’t tell us...
(turns to Wayne)
It must be a defense prototype.
WAYNE: Could you find out?
FOX: I’ll make a couple calls... I still
have a couple friends in defense.

INT. D.A.’S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

Gordon finds it. Knocks. Rachel looks up from her desk.
RACHEL: Sergeant Gordon?
GORDON: Councilor. Thanks for seeing me.
Gordon enters, shuts the door behind himself.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 91.
GORDON (CONT’D): (they shake hands)
Will Finch go the distance on
Falcone?
RACHEL: He’ll have to because of the press.
GORDON: What about Judge Phelan?
RACHEL: Someone gave me leverage.
GORDON: Who?
RACHEL: I’d rather not say.
GORDON: (shrugs)
There’s a loose thread on the
Falcone case- I want to see what
unravels higher up. I’m told you
can be trusted.
RACHEL: Who told you that?
GORDON: (smiles)
I’d rather not say.
Rachel looks at Gordon, sizing him up.
RACHEL: Gordon, we’re working for a masked
vigilante. Maybe from a rival gang.
GORDON: My gut says he’s okay. And he’s
getting things moving in this town.
RACHEL: And when he gets bolder with
success? Goes too far?
GORDON: Councilor, this guy took down a
dozen of Gotham’s most vicious
wiseguys single-handed and without
killing one of them- he’s plenty
bold already.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 92.
RACHEL: If he takes a life... it’s on us.
Gordon looks at her. Nods. A KNOCK at the door. Wayne puts
his head around the door. Rachel stares at him.
WAYNE: I’m sorry, I’ll come back.
GORDON: I was just leaving, Mr.Wayne.
WAYNE: I’m sorry, have we..?
GORDON: Gordon. Sergeant. No, I just
recognized you. From your pictures.
Wayne nods. Gordon looks at Rachel, nods goodbye.
RACHEL: (cold)
What do you want, Bruce?
WAYNE: I wanted to invite you a party-
RACHEL: A party. Great. Just what I need...
WAYNE: Today’s my birthday. And I wanted
to apologize.
RACHEL: You don’t owe an apology, Bruce.
You are who you are. It’ simple. I
don’t have the right to expect
anything more.
WAYNE: I thought you could never quite
give up on me.
RACHEL: Is the party at the house? I miss
it.
WAYNE: I hate the place. I’d tear it down
if I could.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (4): 93.
RACHEL: (appalled)
Bruce, don’t say that.
WAYNE: The place is nothing without the
people who made it what it was. Now
there’s only Alfred.
RACHEL: And you.
Rachel looks at him. An ASSISTANT sticks her head in.
ASSISTANT: It’s Falcone. They moved him to
Arkham Asylum on suicide watch.
RACHEL: Who authorized that?!
ASSISTANT: Judge Bentley, on the advice of the
head psychiatrist, Dr.Jonathan
Crane.
Rachel starts getting her things together.
RACHEL: Get Crane there right now- don’t
take no for an answer... and call
Dr.Lehmann, we’ll need our own
assessment on the Judge’s desk by
morning.
The Assistant nods, leaves. Rachel heads for the door.
RACHEL (CONT’D): Guess I won’t make your party...
WAYNE: You’re going to Arkham now? It’s in
the Narrows, Rachel.
Rachel gives him a look.
RACHEL: You have yourself a great time-
some of us have work to do.
She hurries past him. Stops. Turns. Looks at him, softer.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (5): 94.
RACHEL (CONT’D): Happy Birthday, Bruce.
She races down the steps. Wayne watches her go, thinking.

INT. MAIN HALL, WAYNE MANOR -- LATER

Wayne hurries through the hall. Alfred in pursuit. Tables of
food and decoration fill the hall.
ALFRED: But Master Wayne, the guests will
be arriving.
Wayne turns.
WAYNE: Keep them happy until I arrive.
Tell them that joke you know.
Wayne hurries off. Alfred watches him go, exasperated.

INT. STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne steps to the piano, hits 4 notes- the bookcase
SWINGSOPEN. Wayne steps through.

INT. STONE STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne descends. Arrives at the top of a wrought iron SPIRAL
STAIRCASE, steps onto the dumb waiter at its center.
Wayne pulls a lever, RELEASING the lift which PLUMMETS
VERTIGINOUSLY DOWN the CENTER of the SPIRALING stair.

INT. BATCAVE -- CONTINUOUS

The lift hits the bottom with a great RATTLE of crimes.
Wayne moves to a PADLOCKED BOX. Opens it: the BAT SUIT hangs
there- a PHANTOM, black eyes STARING back at him. He reaches
for it.

EXT. ARKHAM ASYLUM, THE NARROWS -- EVENING

Rachel’s car crosses the bridge to the Narrows.
95.

INT. CRANE’S OFFICE, ARKHAM ASYLUM -- MOMENTS LATER

Rachel sits in front of Crane at his desk..
CRANE: Ms.Dodson, there’s nothing to add
to the report I filed with the
judge.
RACHEL: Well, I have questions about your
report.
(off look)
Such as, is it unusual for a
58-year old man with no history of
mental illness to have a complete
psychotic break?
CRANE: Yes. But this is a mental asylum
for the criminally insane. The
unusual is usual here.

EXT. ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

The GLOWING WINDOW of Crane’s office. Batman, crouched on
the fence, adjusts mikes in the ears of his cowl.

INT. CRANE’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

RACHEL: But isn’t it convenient for Falcone
to suddenly develop these symptoms
when he’s about to be indicted?
CRANE: There’s nothing convenient about
his symptoms, Miss Dodson.
(smiles, sympathetic)
Look, I doubt we’re even supposed
to be having this conversation, but
off the record...
Crane RISES, motioning.
96.

INT. CORRIDOR, ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

An ORDERLY talking to a NURSE. Crane leads Rachel past.
CRANE: We’re not talking about a few
easily-manufactured eccentricities.
Crane stops at a door. Motions Rachel to look: Falcone
STRAPPED to the bed. He STARES at the door, mumbling.
FALCONE: Scarecrow... s-scarecrow... s-s...
RACHEL: What’s "scarecrow"?
CRANE: Patients suffering delusional
episodes often focus their paranoia
onto an external tormentor, usually
one conforming to the Jungian
archetypes.
(shrugs)
In this case, a scarecrow.

EXT. ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

Batman, upside down, CLINGS to the wall above the window at
the end of the corridor. He RACKS AUDIO FOCUS THROUGH the
Orderly’s conversation, SETTLING on Crane’s voice.

INT. CORRIDOR, ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel looks at Falcone, mumbling, delusional.
RACHEL: He’s drugged.
CRANE: (nods)
Psychopharmacology is my primary
field- I’m a strong advocate.
Crane turns to Falcone. Staring.
CRANE (CONT’D): Outside, he was a giant. In here,
only the mind can grant you power.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 97.
RACHEL: You enjoy the reversal.
CRANE: (shrugs, smiles)
I respect the mind’s power over the
body. It’s why I do what I do.
RACHEL: (hard)
And I do what I do to put scum like
Falcone behind bars, not in
therapy. I want my own psychiatric
consultant to have full access to
Falcone, including bloodwork to
find out exactly what you have him
on.
Crane stares at her. Shrugs.

INT. ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS

Crane steps in, Rachel follows. He puts a key into the
panel.
CRANE: First thing tomorrow, then.
RACHEL: Tonight. I’ve already paged
Dr.Lehmann over at County General.
Crane turns the key.
CRANE: As you wish.
The elevator descends. The doors open onto:

INT. DESERTED WING, SUB-LEVEL ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS168

A long, decrepit corridor. Water dripping, clearly disused.
Crane steps off the elevator. Rachel follows, perturbed.

INT. ABANDONED REFECTORY -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel follows Crane into a vast room: Tables stretch off into the room, covered in bags of powder,
scales, aluminum barrels and DOZENS OF INMATES working the
powder, refining it.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 98.
Armed THUGS look up, curious. Crane surveys the room.
CRANE: This is where we make the medicine.
Perhaps you should have some. Clear
your head.
He turns, but Rachel is gone. Crane smiles...

INT. DERELICT CORRIDOR, DISUSED WING -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel RACES into the elevator...

INT. ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel HITS the 2nd floor button. Nothing. She HITS all the
buttons, floors the alarm... all dead without the key.
The door opens to Crane’s MASKED FACE. He reaches out-
CRANE: Boo.
A small puff of GAS sprays from his sleeve. Rachel RECOILS,
coughing, choking. She looks up at Crane: The eyeholes of the burlap mask are FLAMING.
Rachel SCREAMS.

INT. ABANDONED REFECTORY, ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

The Thugs DRAG Rachel into the room. The inmates stare
blankly, clearly drugged. Crane turns Rachel’s reluctant
face to look up at his mask. She GULPS PANIC BREATHS-
CRANE: Who knows you’re here? Rachel
SHAKES her head.
CRANE (CONT’D):
WHO KNOWS?!!: Rachel PULLS away, BURYING her head in her arms.
THE LIGHTS GO OUT.
The Thugs look around, unnerved. Crane PULLS OFF his mask.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 99.
CRANE (CONT’D): (fascinated)
He’s here.
FIRST THUG: Who?
CRANE: The batman.
The Thugs exchange nervous glances.
FIRST THUG: What do we do?
CRANE: What anyone does when a prowler
comes around.
(off look)
Call the police.
The First Thug looks at Crane.
SECOND TECHNICIAN: You want the cops here?
CRANE: At this point, they’re irrelevant.
But the Batman... he has a talent
for disruption. Let the cops
wrangle him.
CRANE (CONT’D): Force him outside, the police will
take him down.
(indicates inmates)
Get them out of here.
FIRST THUG: (indicates Rachel)
What about her?
CRANE: She’s gone. I gave her a
concentrated dose. The mind can
only take so much.
SECOND THUG: The things they say about him...
Can he really fly?
100.

EXT. ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

Batman’s cape FLUTTERS as he SWINGS down two stories,
LANDING at the high windows of the derelict corridor.

INT. ABANDONED REFECTORY -- CONTINUOUS

THIRD THUG: I heard he can disappear-
Crane backs into the shadows, smiling at the Third Thug.
CRANE: We’ll find out, won’t we?
The Thugs move either side of the door... GLASS SMASHES,
across the room- a Shadow drops from a high window. Rachel
SCREAMS. The two thugs advance through the darkness.
Second thug is GRABBED from above- PULLED UP, SCREAMING,
into the blackness of the rafters.
The First Thug peers up into the darkness, gun aimed.
A SHADOW DESCENDS, SHOUTING- First Thug FIRES- the Shadow
CRUMPLES onto him. It is the Second Thug- First Thug ROLLS
the body off, SCRAMBLES to his feet- Batman STRIKES him from
behind, KNOCKING him unconscious.
SIRENS outside, close.
Batman looks at Rachel-
Crane BURSTS from the shadows, arm high, aimed at Batman’s
face- Batman grabs his arm, DUCKING away from the puff of
GAS from Crane’s sleeve... Batman SPINS Crane, RIPPING off
his mask, WRENCHES his arm around to his own face, RIPS
Crane’s jacket open and pulls out the BLADDER full of toxin.
BATMAN: Taste of your own medicine, doctor?
Crane’s eyes go wide as Batman SQUEEZES the bladder and a
choking cloud of dust sprays into Crane’s face...
Crane falls to the ground, CHOKING. Batman turns him over,
pulls his face up to meet his.
BATMAN (CONT’D): Who are you working for?!
Crane’s eyes are wide with TERROR.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 101.
Batman is a DEATH’S HEAD- black eyes, fangs.
CRANE: Ra’s... Ra’s... Al Ghul...
Batman reacts, pulls Crane tighter.
BATMAN: Ra’s Al Ghul is dead, Crane! Who
are you really working for?
CRANE!!!: But Crane just STARES at him, EYES GLAZING- MIND
FLYINGIMAGES CASCADING THROUGH HIS FEVERED BRAIN... Crane
smiles.
CRANE: Dr. Crane isn’t here right now, but
if you’d like to make an
appointment-
Sirens outside. Batman TURNS to Rachel. Through her eyes: Batman is a towering HORNED, WINGED DEMON...
Rachel LASHES OUT at the demon with all her might... Batman
applies a GRIP to her neck that renders her unconscious.
COP: (over bullhorn)
BATMAN. PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS AND
SURRENDER. YOU ARE SURROUNDED.
Batman RISES, carrying Rachel.

EXT. ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

POLICE CARS surround the building. COPS have guns drawn,
WAITING. STAFF emerge, blinking, from the darkened asylum.
Flass and Gordon arrive. Flass shouts at the Uniforms:
FLASS: What’re you waiting for?!
UNIFORMED COP: Backup.
FLASS: Backup?!
Flass gestures at the DOZEN police cars outside the
building.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 102.
UNIFORMED COP: The Batman’s in there. SWAT’s on
the way, but if you want to go
now...
(smiles)
I’m right behind you, sir.
Flass turns to Gordon. Shrugs.
FLASS: SWAT’s on the way.
Gordon shakes his head. Approaches the front doors.

The SWAT team BURSTS in- FLASHLIGHTS on RIFLES SCAN the
darkness...

INT. STAIRWELL, ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon locks down the stairwell- the way down to the disused
wing is fenced off. He heads up- and is GRABBED and SWUNG
OUT into the stairwell. Batman holds him as they ROCKET
UPWARDS.:
GORDON: What-!
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 103.
Batman covers Gordon’s mouth- down below: the door SMASHES
OPEN- SWAT team lights CROSS the darkened stairwell. Batman
PULLS Gordon into the rafters. Gordon turns, FURIOUS- sees: Rachel. Lying in a storage space/open attic. Twitching:
GORDON (CONT’D): (whispering)
What’s happened to her?
BATMAN: Crane poisoned her with his toxin.
He was the third man at the docks.
GORDON: Let me take her down to the medics-
BATMAN: They can’t help her. But I can.
THE LIGHTS COME ON- bleaching the stairwell- Batman, Rachel
and Gordon are in the shadow of the attic.
Batman reaches down to his boot. Presses a SWITCH in the
heel, producing a barely audible HIGH-FREQUENCY WHINE.
BATMAN (CONT’D): (indicates Rachel)
I need to get her the antidote
before the damage becomes
permanent.
GORDON: How long does she have?
BATMAN: Not long.

EXT. ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

A strange SQUEALING SOUND rises. Flass looks around,
curious. A dark CLOUD crosses the moon... not a regular
cloud...

INT. STAIRWELL, ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

BATMAN: Get her downstairs, meet me in the
alley on the Narrows side.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 104.
GORDON: How will you get out?
BATMAN: (indicates his boot)
I called for backup. Crane’s been
refining his toxin, stockpiling it.
GORDON: What was he planning?
BATMAN: I don’t know, but he’s been working
for someone else.
Gordon frowns at the loud SQUEALING noise.
GORDON: What is that?
BATMAN: Backup.

EXT. ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon covers Rachel as he carries her down the steps.

INT. ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

Bats FLOOD into the bright stairwell, SOARING UP past the
cowering SWATS, a BLACK MASS RISING, DARKENING the
stairwell.
Batman amidst the bats. Calm. Pulls the sounder out of his
heel, leans over the stairwell and DROPS it...
Bats CYCLONE down the stairwell, FOLLOWING the signal.
Batman JUMPS into the center of the black cyclone- HIDDEN
FALLING...: 105.

INT. CORRIDOR, ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

Batman OPENS his cloak with a JOLT- lands HARD. He moves
calmly through the bats, slipping past COWERING SWATS,
moving past cell doors. Inmates STARE, wide-eyed out their
windows as he passes. Batman turns to a cell door, pulls a
small package out of his utility belt...

INT. CELL -- CONTINUOUS

Two inmates FLINCH as the door lock BLASTS open and the door
is KICKED In- Batman STRIDES across the cell between them...
BATMAN: Excuse me-
And BLASTS the window of their cell. He SLIDES out... one
Inmate turns to the other.
LUNATIC: What’d I tell ya?

EXT. SIDE STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon lowers Rachel to the asphalt. She STIRS.
BATMAN (O.S.): How is she?
Gordon looks up to see Batman standing there.
A SEARCHLIGHT from a chopper blasts them. Batman GRABS
Rachel. Gordon points back to the street.
GORDON: Take my car.
BATMAN: I bought mine.
Batman has disappeared into the dark end of the alley.
GORDON: Yours?
BLINDING HEADLIGHTS FLARE. A MASSIVE ENGINE ROARS-
Gordon DIVES out of the way as-
The BATMOBILE comes flying out of the darkness... the
matteblack, muscularity of the stealth-finished "car" BLOWS
by. Gordon’s jaw drops.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 106.
GORDON (CONT’D): I gotta get me one of those.

Rachel BRACES against the dash, BREATHING FAST, staring at
the road ahead... through her eyes: SPEED: pure, visceral SENSATION- lights STREAKING, columns
FLASHING past at unthinkable velocity-
BATMAN: You’ve been poisoned. Stay calm.
He looks at an intricate GPS display, then at the road
ahead.

EXT. SURFACE STREETS, GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

INT. BATMOBILE -- CONTINUOUS

Batman spots the Cops on a rear-view monitor, FLIPS a
switch.

EXT. SURFACE STREETS, GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

The Batmobile DROPS SPIKE STRIPS onto the road... the Cop

Up ahead: the Batmobile SLALOMS outside of the freeway
supports, ROLLS over the sidewalk, NIPS back into the
roadway.

The Batmobile comes out from under the elevated freeway and
is hit by a SPOTLIGHT from a CHOPPER.

INT. BATMOBILE -- CONTINUOUS

Batman glances at a row of BUTTONS- each one a tiny SCREEN
showing different views. Batman PUSHES one- that view flicks
onto the main display. Rachel is HYPERVENTILATING.
BATMAN: Breath slowly. Close your eyes.
She does so. For an instant.
RACHEL: That’s worse!

EXT. STREETS, GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

Three Cop Cars pull across the intersection in a ROADBLOCK.

INT. BATMOBILE -- CONTINUOUS

Batman SPOTS the ROADBLOCK in front. Touches the GPS screen-
the map becomes THREE-DIMENSIONAL (heights of building,
levels of streets). Batman SKIDS into a turn-

EXT. SURFACE STREETS, GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

The Batmobile SKIDS through the entrance to a multi-level
PARKING GARAGE- TAKING OUT the ticket machine and barrier.

Cop Cars SMASH into DOWNED PILLARS in the Batmobile’s wake.

The Batmobile REVERSES into a spot marked "COMPACT",
CRUSHING the cars either side, then RACES forward... Cop
Cars emerge onto the roof, BLOCKING THE ONLY WAY DOWN... The
Batmobile SCREECHES to a HALT-

INT. BATMOBILE -- CONTINUOUS

Batman glances at his 3-d GPS. Then looks at Rachel.
COP 3: (over loudspeaker)
TURN OFF YOUR ENGINE!
She recoils, TERRIFIED by his mask, clawing at her harness.
Batman puts his gloved hand on her frantic arms.
BATMAN: Trust me.
Batman SLIDES into the FRONT DRIVING POSITION, body PRONE as
if riding a motorcycle, head in a glass POD between the
front wheels. He HITS a button.

EXT. ROOF, PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS

CANNONS emerge from the nose of the Batmobile- BLASTING the
far wall... the massive JET ENGINE at the back IGNITES, its
mouth ADJUSTING... FLAPS on the front and REAR of the car,
FLARE OUT like a PYTHON spreading its neck...

Corp Cars SHOOT along, paralleling the rooftop chase...FROM

The Batmobile lands on the PITCHED ROOF, racing along at a

EXT. ROOFTOPS -- CONTINUOUS

Chased by the LOW-FLYING chopper, the Batmobile SWERVES up
over the GABLES, roof CRUMBLING in its wake, RACING for the

Cop Cars see the Batmobile disappear onto the freeway above.
COP 4: Dammit!

Batman lifts himself back into the REAR DRIVING POSITION-
THROTTLES BACK- KILLS all the lights, and the ENGINE.
112.

The Batmobile DROPS BACK, DARK... the Chopper LOSES IT. The
Batmobile CRUISES across the lanes, a WRAITH.

SILENCE, but for the steady WHINE of the ELECTRIC MOTOR.
Rachel BREATHES in the sudden quiet. Eyes flickering.

EXT. FREEWAY HEADING OUT OF GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS

The Batmobile SLICES across lanes, a SHADOW only visible
BREAKING the GLARE of other cars’ HEADLIGHTS. The Cop Cars

glaring. Her breathing is shallow.
BATMAN: quiet
(Stay with me.)

INT. BATMOBILE -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel, crying, looks at the monstrous shapes of the trees: FLICKERING, jagged tree shapes SPIN past DIZZYINGLY.
BATMAN: Rachel? Rachel?!
No reply. Up ahead: a LOOKOUT over a river gorge. Batman
PUSHES the Batmobile, SPEEDING towards the lookout. Rachel’s
glazes eyes REGISTER the danger- she TWISTS, PANICKED...
114.

EXT. WOODED PATH -- CONTINUOUS

The Batmobile ROCKETS off the edge of the lookout, over the
gorge, FLYING STRAIGHT AT THE FACE OF A WATERFALL.

Rachel SCREAMS as they SPLASH INTO THE FACE OF THE
WATERFALL-:

INT. CAVERNS -- CONTINUOUS

-AND EMERGE THROUGH THE CURTAIN OF WATER into the BATCAVE.
The Batmobile’s ground ANCHORS hook a steel CABLE, spinning
an INERTIA REEL bolted to the cave wall, YANKING the car to
a halt like a jet landing on an aircraft carrier.

INT. BATMOBILE -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel BOUNCES in her seat. PASSED OUT.

INT. BATCAVE -- CONTINUOUS

The canopy of the Batmobile hisses open in three complex
sections, like insect wings IMPLODING. Batman LIFTS Rachel
from the cockpit, steps down onto wet shale... CARRIES her
into the damp blackness of the caverns.
Cloak BILLOWING in his wake, he heads for the GLOW of his
work table. Gently lays Rachel on the table. RACKS up the
scaffold to his computer station. A CONTAINER sits there
with paperwork from Fox. Batman opens it, removes a VIAL. He
plugs it into a pneumatic SYRINGE, puts the syringe between
his teeth- GLIDES off the scaffold, LANDING beside Rachel.
He INJECTS her in the biceps.
Batman steps back, watching Rachel’s breathing SLOW.

INT. ABANDONED REFECTORY, ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon surveys the scene: COPS and SWATS dig through the
mess, interviewing Inmates and sifting rubble. A DETECTIVE
sits in a cell doorway examining Crane’s mask. Crane is
huddled in the corner, STARING.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 115.
GORDON: Is he cooperating?
DETECTIVE: If by cooperating you mean chewing
his way through three sets of
restraints, then yes, he’s
cooperating. Did we catch the
Batman?
Gordon tries not to smile.
GORDON: Nope.
A cop hurries over.
COP: Sir, there’s something you should
take a look at...

INT. DERELICT BATH HOUSE, ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

Tiled baths and hydrotherapy equipment. A POOL in the
center. The Cop leads Gordon to the edge... A massive HOLE
has been dug through the bottom.
Dozens of ALUMINUM BARRELS sit alongside. Gordon climbs
down, PEERS into the hole... A TORRENT of water runs at the
bottom.
GORDON: Looks like they tapped the mains...
Gordon looks at the dozens of aluminum barrels. Realizing.
GORDON (CONT’D): Get me somebody at the water board!

INT. BATCAVE -- LATER

Rachel’s eyes flicker open to the cavernous damp darkness.
She sees BATS banging high above. CLOSES her eyes again.
RACHEL: (under her breath)
Oh. My. God.
BATMAN (O.S.): How do you feel?
His voice ECHOES as if spoken from al shadows at once.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 116.
RACHEL: (hoarse)
Where are we?
Nothing.
RACHEL (CONT’D): Why did you bring me here?
BATMAN: If I hadn’t... your mind would now
be lost. You were poisoned.
Rachel thinks.., concentrating.., remembering.
RACHEL: I remember... nightmares. This...
face, this... mask.
(realizes)
Crane. It was Crane-
Rachel STRUGGLES off the table, trying to stand.
RACHEL (CONT’D): I have to tell the police- we’ve
got-
She SLIPS- Batman is there, CATCHING her.
BATMAN: Rest. Gordon has Crane.
In his arms she looks up at him- he lays her gently back
onto the table. Retreats into shadow.
RACHEL: Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?
BATMAN: I don’t have the luxury of friends.
Rachel watches this dark shadow hover just outside the
light.
RACHEL: Why did you save my life?
BATMAN: Gotham needs you.
RACHEL: And you serve Gotham?
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 117.
BATMAN: I serve justice.
Rachel STARES at the solitary shadow. Fascinated. Pitying.
RACHEL: Perhaps you do.
Batman steps into the light. Holding a pneumatic syringe and
two vials. Rachel stares at him.
BATMAN: I’m going to give you a sedative.
You’ll wake up back at home...
Batman holds up the two vials.
BATMAN (CONT’D): And when you do, get these to
Gordon, and Gordon alone. Trust no
one.
RACHEL: What are they?
BATMAN: The antidote. One for Gordon to
inoculate himself, the other to
start mass-production.
Batman hands Rachel the vials. She looks at him, curious.
BATMAN (CONT’D): Crane was just a pawn. He was
working for someone else.
RACHEL: (remembering)
Ghul... something Al Ghul...
BATMAN: Ra’s Al Ghul. It’s not him. He’s
dead.
RACHEL: How do you know?
BATMAN: I watched him die.
Batman approaches with the syringe. Rachel offers her arm.
Batman injects her. Her eyes close. Batman removes his cowl.
Wayne stands above the sleeping Rachel. Stares at her for an
inexpressibly lonely moment.
118.

INT. BATH HOUSE, ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon is on the phone-
GORDON: Someone’s been dumping a dangerous
contaminant into the supply from
this location for days, maybe
weeks-

INT. CONTROL ROOM, WATER BOARD -- CONTINUOUS

Two TECHNICIANS sit there, one on the phone to Gordon. A
large screen in front of them maps the water supply of
Gotham.
TECHNICIAN: If that’s true then it’s already
spread through the whole system.
But no one’s reported any
effects...

INT. BATH HOUSE, ARKHAM ASYLUM -- CONTINUOUS

Gordon looks around, thinking, frustrated.
GORDON: It must be like chlorine or
fluoride- harmless to drink, but
when you breathe it it’s deadly...
look, wake up your boss, see if
there’s a way to flush out the
system.
Gordon hangs up. Frustrated. Notices something. A large
SHIPPING CRATE. He turns to the Cop.
GORDON (CONT’D): Open that up.

INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR -- EVENING

Wayne emerges from the bookcase. The noise of a PARTY
outside the door. Alfred is there waiting, dinner jacket
over his arm. Wayne grabs the shirt- dressing hastily.
WAYNE: Rachel’s sedated. You can take her
home.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 119.
ALFRED: Very good, sir.
WAYNE: Is Fox still here?
(Alfred nods)
Tell your staff to stop serving
drinks and move everybody on after
the cake.
Alfred nods. Wayne moves to the door. Alfred STOPS him.
Hands him a towel, gesturing at his face: Wayne is still
wearing BLACK MAKEUP around his eyes.

INT. MAIN HALL, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

Hundreds of GUESTS. Music. Tables groaning with food
FEMALE GUEST (O.S.): There he is!
Guests look up- Wayne WADES INTO the throng, GRINNING and
GLAD-HANDING. The band strikes up with "Happy Birthday",
Wayne spots Fox at the buffet.

EXT. SIDE ENTRANCE, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

As sounds from the party drift over, Alfred gently arranges
the unconscious Rachel on the rear seat of the car. He
frowns as Rachel’s legs get stuck. He looks up to see a
PARTY GUEST, cigarette in hand, staring, curious.
ALFRED: (smiles)
A little the worse for wear, I’m
afraid.
Alfred YANKS Wayne’s gold clubs to one side, Rachel settles.

INT. MAIN HALL, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

Guests are leaving. Wayne works the room, charming, but
distracted... heading to Fox.
WAYNE: Any word on that... item.
Fox nods, glances around. Leans in, conspiratorial.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 120.
FOX: A contact in heavy weapons tipped
me off- it’s a microwave emitter.
It vaporizes water.
Wayne thinks.
WAYNE: Could you sue it to put a
biological agent into the air?
FOX: Sure, if the water supply were
poisoned before you vaporized it.
Wayne takes this in. Grave. Nods at Fox.
EARLE (O.S.): Happy Birthday, Bruce.
Wayne turns to Earle.
WAYNE: Mr.Earle, good of you to come.
EARLE: (smiles)
Not everybody thought you’d make it
this far.
WAYNE: Sorry to disappoint. How did the
stock offering go?
EARLE: Very well- the price soared.
WAYNE: Who was buying?
EARLE: A variety of funds and
brokerages... it’s all a bit
technical- the key thing is, our
company’s future is secure.
Wayne nods. Gestures to Fox.
WAYNE: Have you met Lucius Fox?
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 121.
EARLE: Of course, Lucius, how are you?
WAYNE: Fox is showing me the ropes down at
Applied Sciences... he’s a great
untapped resource at our company,
aren’t you, Mr.Fox?
Fox shoots Wayne a look, but Wayne WINKS and moves off.
FOX: He’s a good kid.
EARLE: (cold)
Fox, forget about kissing Wayne’s
ass to get back in- I’m merging

Wayne moves across the party, heading for the study... An
ELDERLY SOCIETY DAME grabs him-
SOCIETY DAME: Bruce, there’s somebody here you
simply must meet...
WAYNE: Mrs. Delane, I can’t just now...
She TURNS Wayne to face an ASIAN MAN in his fifties.
SOCIETY DAME: Now, am I pronouncing it right..?
In the Asian Man’s buttonhole is a DOUBLE-BLOOMED BLUE
POPPY.:
SOCIETY DAME (CONT’D): Mr. Al Ghul?
The Asian Man nods. Wayne STARES at him.
WAYNE: You’re not Ra’s Al Ghul. He’s dead.
The Society Dame laughs nervously, confused.
VOICE (O.S.): But is Ra’s Al Ghul immortal..?
Wayne TURNS. Standing there. Smiling. Ducard.
DUCARD: Are his methods supernatural..?
WAYNE: (understanding)
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your trues identity.., Ra’s?
Ducard (THE REAL RA’S AL GHUL) smiles acknowledgment.
DUCARD/RA’S AL GHUL: Surely you don’t begrudge me dual
identities?
Ra’s Al Ghul walks Wayne through the dwindling party.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 123.
RA’S AL GHUL: I’ve been admiring your work, even
as it’s interfered with my plans...
Ra’s Al Ghul looks at Wayne with a tinge of sadness.
RA’S AL GHUL (CONT’D)
You were my greatest student...
until you betrayed me.
Wayne notices CERTAIN GUESTS staring at him: members of the
League of Shadows. Wayne looks at the departing Guests.
WAYNE: Your quarrel is with me. Let these
people go.
RA’S AL GHUL: As you wish. But they don’t have
long to live- your antics at the
Asylum have forced my hand...
WAYNE: Crane was working for you.
RA’S AL GHUL: His toxin is derived from the
organic compound in our blue
poppies. Crane was able weaponize
the compound. A brilliant
scientist, but no visionary. He
just wanted money and power-
(smiles)
I told him the plan was to hold the
city to ransom... but, in fact-
WAYNE: You’re going to unleash Crane’s
poison on the entire city...
RA’S AL GHUL: (nods, serious)
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear...

INT. LIBRARY, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne and Ra’s enter. The library is empty of guest.
WAYNE: You’re going to destroy millions of
lives.
RA’S AL GHUL: No. Billions of lives. Gotham is
just the beginning. The world will
watch in terror as the greatest
city falls. Anarchy and chaos will
spread... mankind will ravage
itself, the species will be culled
and the balance of nature restored.
The planet will be saved for all
species.
Wayne stares at Ra’s appalled.
WAYNE: You’re inhuman.
RA’S AL GHUL: Don’t question my humanity,
Brucewhen I found you in that fetid
hole you were lost. I saved you- I
showed you a path and took away
your fear- I made you what you are.
(stares at Wayne)
And in return... you attacked me
and burned my home...
Ra’s looks up at his MEN in the gallery. Nods. The Men start
SETTING FIRE TO THE DRAPES.
RA’S AL GHUL (CONT’D)
Since then, you’ve used my skills
and techniques to interfere with my
plans, plans in which you were
supposed to play a part...
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 125.
WAYNE: What part was that, Ra’s? To put my
company at your disposal? To obtain
your microwave emitter and plant it
somewhere in Gotham?
RA’S AL GHUL: (smiles, nods)
You were supposed to be Gotham’s
destroyer... instead you became her
only protector.
WAYNE: You underestimate Gotham.
RA’S AL GHUL: You underestimate Gotham’s
corruptionwe’ve infiltrated every
aspect of the city’s
infrastructure...

The FLAMES ARE RISING. SMOKE GATHERING at the ceiling...
RA’S AL GHUL: Gotham is helpless without you.
That’s why I’m here.
WAYNE: To kill me?
Ra’s Al Ghul looks at Wayne. Emotional.
RA’S AL GHUL: To bring you back to us, Bruce. The
world will need great men like you-
WAYNE: To take power.
RA’S AL GHUL: This is not about power... this is
about saving the planet before man
destroys it with his greed, with
his pollution, with his weaponry...
Ra’s holds out his hand. A Ninja THROWS him a SWORD. He
HANDS it to Wayne, placing the point at his own throat.
RA’S AL GHUL (CONT’D)
You still doubt me? Apply a few
pounds of pressure... buy your
precious city a reprieve.
Ra’s looks into Wayne’s eyes with absolute conviction.
RA’S AL GHUL (CONT’D)
Kill me. Then you’ll understand how
simple it is to do what’s
necessary.
Wayne holds the sword at Ra’s throat. Thinking. Ra’s stares
at Wayne with absolute conviction.
WAYNE: I will not take life. I will not be
a part of this.
RA’S AL GHUL: But you already are. You’ve given
Gotham a potent symbol of fear...
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 127.
WAYNE: I frighten criminals.
RA’S AL GHUL: You frighten everybody. A giant
vengeful bat? What better
apocalyptic symbol to haunt
Gothams’ dreams as panic takes
hold?
Wayne stares at Ra’s Al Ghul. Pulls the sword away from his
throat. Ra’s Al Ghul looks at him, contemptuous. Pulls at
the handle of his cane, producing a SWORD.
RA’S AL GHUL (CONT’D)
Then die with Gotham-
Ra’s STRIKES Wayne’s sword from his throat- lays into him,
sword in one hand, CANE/SHEATH in the other-

OFF BALANCE- Wayne dodges- Ra’s goes DOWN- Wayne holds his
sword at Ra’s throat...
WAYNE: Perhaps you taught me too well.
Ra’s looks up at Wayne with a sly smile.
RA’S AL GHUL: Or perhaps you’ll never learn-
A section of the BURNING GALLERY DROPS onto Wayne.
RA’S AL GHUL (CONT’D)
-to mind your surroundings as well
as your opponent.
Ra’s RISES. Looks down at Wayne, unconscious, PINNED under

the microwave emitter...
RACHEL: They were lifting a machine up to
the tracks...
Batman TURNS to face Rachel, realizing-
BATMAN: Of course- the monorail. The track
runs directly over the water
mains...
Batman turns to the city, stares at the wide sweep of the
monorail tracks. The "spoke" that lead in to Wayne Tower...

He draws his sword from his cane. Batman LUNGES at Ra’s, who
SWINGS his sword at him- Batman PARRIES with his gauntlet,
SPARKS striking off the metal scallops.
The train SHOOTS through a building, the airflow WHUMPING
down on the duelists...
Ra’s SWINGS his cane- Batman TRAPS it in his scallop- TWISTS
his arm- sends the cane SPINNING away.
RA’S AL GHUL (CONT’D)

INT. ROLLS -- CONTINUOUS

Earle is BANGING on the window. Wayne rolls it down.
EARLE: You think you have authority to

WAYNE: And I bought most of the shares. A
controlling interest, in fact.

Alfred is smiling in the front seat.
WAYNE (CONT’D): Look, it’s all a bit technical, but
the important thing is.... my
company’s future is secure.
Earle is speechless. Wayne smiles. The Rolls pulls away.

EXT. GROUNDS, SMOKING RUINS OF WAYNE MANOR -- DAY

WORKERS sift through the smoking ruins, supervised by
Alfred.

INT. ORANGERY -- CONTINUOUS

Soot-stained glass crunches underfoot as Rachel picks her
way through the smoking remnants of the greenhouse.

EXT. DISUSED KITCHEN GARDEN -- CONTINUOUS

Rachel finds Wayne hammering a board across the disused
well. He looks up at her. She approaches. He turns to the
well.
WAYNE: Do you remember the day I fell?
RACHEL: Of course.
Wayne looks down at the black gap yet to be covered.
WAYNE: As I lay there, I knew... I could
sense it...
RACHEL: What?
WAYNE: That things would never be the
same.
RACHEL: What did you find down there? Wayne
picks up another board.
WAYNE: Childhood’s end.
Wayne places the board over over the gap. Closing the well.

EXT. SMOKING RUINS OF WAYNE MANOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Wayne walks Rachel past the ruins.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 145.
RACHEL: The day you left Gotham... the day
Chill was murdered... I said
terrible things.
WAYNE: True things. You made me see that
justice is about more than my own
pain and anger.
RACHEL: Well, you proved me wrong.
WAYNE: About what?
RACHEL: Your father would be proud of you.
Just as I am.
Wayne looks at her, emotion rising. He takes Rachel in his
arms and they kiss, passionately... desperately.
They break, Wayne looks into Rachel’s eyes, hopeful. But she
gently shakes her head.
RACHEL (CONT’D): (soft)
Between Batman and Bruce Wayne,
there’s no room for me.
WAYNE: Rachel, this life I chose... I can
give it up.
Rachel reaches up to his face with her hand.
RACHEL: You didn’t choose the life, Bruce.
It was thrust upon you, the way
greatness often is. You’ve given
this city hope- now she’s depending
on you. We all are.
Wayne looks at her. Aching. He nods.
RACHEL (CONT’D): Good-bye, Bruce.
She walks away. Stops. Turns. Points at the ruins.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 146.
RACHEL (CONT’D): What will you do?
Wayne looks at her. Glorious purpose in his eyes.
WAYNE: I’m going to rebuild it just the
way it was. Brick for brick.
Rachel nods. Walks off. Wayne stares after her. Alone...
But Alfred is at Wayne’s shoulder. Watching his gaze.
ALFRED: Just the way it was, sir?
Wayne turns to Alfred.
WAYNE: Yes, why?
They stroll, side by side, towards the smoking ruins.
ALFRED: I thought we might take the
opportunity of making some
improvements to the foundation.
WAYNE: In the south east corner?
ALFRED: Precisely, sir.

clouds... and we are-

EXT. ROOF, POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

Gordon sips coffee from a styrofoam cup. Beside him- an
upturned spotlight with a METAL STENCIL bolted to it.
A dark FLUTTERING, and Batman is standing the other side of
the spotlight. He reaches out, taps the stencil.
BATMAN: Nice.
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (2): 147.
GORDON: (crushing his cup)
Couldn’t find any mob bosses to
strap to the light.
Gordon kills the searchlight. The two men stand opposite
each other in the dark.
BATMAN: Well, Sergeant?
GORDON: It’s Lieutenant, now. Commissioner
Loeb had to promote me. And he had
to disband the task force hunting
you. Amazing what saving a city can
do for your image.
BATMAN: Then things are better.
GORDON: (nods)
You’ve started something- bent cops
running scared, hope on the
streets...
Gordon leaves his sentence hanging between them.
BATMAN: But?
GORDON: But there’s a lot of weirdness out
there right now... the Narrows is
lost... we still haven’t picked up
Crane or half the inmates of Arkham
that he freed...
BATMAN: We will. Gotham will return to
normal.
GORDON: Will it? What about escalation?
BATMAN: Escalation?
GORDON: We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics... we start
wearing kevlar, they buy
armorpiercing rounds...
(CONTINUED):
CONTINUED: (3): 148.
BATMAN: And?
Gordon leans closer to Batman. Points at him.
GORDON: And... you’re wearing a mask and
jumping off rooftops...
Gordon fishes in his pocket.
GORDON (CONT’D): Take this guy...
He pulls out a clear plastic evidence bag.
GORDON (CONT’D): ...armed robbery, double
homicide...
Inside the clear plastic bag is a PLAYING CARD.
GORDON (CONT’D): Got a taste for theatrics, like
you...
Gordon hands Batman the bag.
GORDON (CONT’D): Leaves a calling card.
Batman turns the card over. It is a JOKER.
BATMAN: I’ll look into it.
He steps up onto the balustrade. Gordon looks at him.
GORDON: I never said thank you.
Batman looks out at the lights of Gotham. Cloak billowing
around him.
BATMAN: And you’ll never have to.
Batman DROPS from the rooftop, GLIDING on the night wind.
Gordon smiles. He can’t help it.

EXT. CROWDED LONDON STREET - DAY

An endless stream of pedestrians crossing the frame.
Cut to a shot looking through pedestrians and reflections of
pedestrians of a Young Man sitting in the window of a coffee
shop, looking out at the people walking past.
MALE VOICE (V.O.): The following is my explanation...
well, my... my account of... well,
what happened.
The Young Man is tall and slim, mid- to late twenties, with
dark, long, greasy hair and unshaven.
We cut to the Young Man outside, on the street. He is peering
ahead as he walks, as if trying to spot a lost friend.
MALE VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
I’d, ah, been on my own for quite a
while by then and I’d
become...lonely...
A wide shot shows the Young Man amidst a bustling Oxford
Street crowd.
MALE VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...and bored. Nothing to do all
day, you see. That’s when I began
shadowing.
OLDER MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Shadowing?
MALE VOICE (V.O.): Yeah, shadowing, following. I
started to follow people.
The young man cuts purposefully through the crowd, in slo-mo.
OLDER MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Who?
MALE VOICE (V.O.): Anyone, a stranger, I mean that was
the whole point; following someone
completely at random. Anyone who
wouldn’t know who you were.
The Young Man is staring at someone fixedly as he moves in
slo-mo. His POV shows us a man’s back dodging between other
people, always threatening to lose us, still in slo-mo.
OLDER MALE VOICE (V.O.)
And then?
MALE VOICE (V.O.): And then nothing.
We SNAP INTO REAL TIME. The man’s back disappears into the
crowd and we cease to follow him. The noises of the city come
up loud.
The Young Man has come to a virtual standstill. He watches
the world washing around him.
OLDER MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Nothing?
MALE VOICE (V.O.): Nothing. I’d follow somebody for a
while then pick someone else and
follow them or go home or whatever.
The Young Man’s eyes dart about, watching the people around
him. He starts to wander down the road, pulled gently by the
flow of pedestrians.
OLDER MALE VOICE (V.O.)
Why did you do it?
MALE VOICE (V.O.): How can I explain? Your eyes pass
over the crowd...
We pan across endless anonymous faces.
MALE VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...and if you let them settle on a
person, then that person becomes an
individual...
We fix on a face, a woman hurrying along.
MALE VOICE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...just...like...THAT...
SHOCK CUT on the sound of SNAPPING FINGERS at ‘THAT’ to: 2.

INT. ROOM WITH TABLE - DAY

Close on fingers in front of the Young Man’s face. He looks
different: hair short, clean shaven, bruised face, a plaster
over one eye. Seated opposite is an OLDER MAN.
YOUNG MAN: It just became...irresistible.
The Older Man considers this before replying.
OLDER MAN: (suspicious)
So you followed women?
YOUNG MAN: It wasn’t some sex thing. I
followed anyone. Just for the sake
of it, just to see where they went,
what they were doing.
OLDER MAN: You were playing secret agent.
YOUNG MAN: (knows its true, but
doesn’t like it)
No... I’m a writer- I want to be a
writer. I wanted to gather material
for characters, you know, to write
about them. All I did was follow
people- to begin with.
DISSOLVE TO::

EXT. BUSY STREET IN THE WEST END - DAY

The Young Man (long hair, unshaven) exits a café and stumbles
along the road. His eye is caught by a man passing by in the
opposite direction. The man is in his mid-twenties, tall,
dark haired wearing a dark suit. He is carrying an overnight
bag.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
I spotted the dangers soon enough.
I could tell I was hooked and I
made up rules.
The Young Man turns about and starts to follow, speeding up
so as not to lose the fast-moving Dark Suit.
Dark Suit weaves in an out of other pedestrians, his bag
slung over his shoulder, heavy.
3.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...I wouldn’t let myself follow
anyone for too long. I wouldn’t
follow women after dark, stuff like
that, simple things just to keep in
all under control.
The Young Man follows, coming up behind Dark Suit as he waits
at a crossing. The lights change and they head across the
road, the Young Man hanging back slightly.
Dark Suit enters Charing Cross station, the Young Man in
pursuit. Dark Suit crosses the station to the left-luggage
office where he hands his bag to the attendant behind the
counter and takes his ticket. He heads back out of the
station. The Young Man follows.
Dark Suit enters a small doorway between two shops. The Young
Man hangs around nearby, before walking up to the doorway and
examining the doorbells. The bells are for flats up above the
shops; most of the names are not marked. He crosses the road
and looks up at the windows, but can’t see much through any
of them. The Young Man shrugs and starts to walk away, but he
hears a door open behind him and he glances back to see Dark
Suit coming out of a doorway carrying another overnight bag.
YOUNG MAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
The most important rule was that
even if I found where a person
worked or lived, I would never
follow the same person twice.
Dark Suit looks about as he comes out on to the pavement and
the Young Man is forced to turn back and continue to walk in
the direction in which he was already headed. When he reaches
the corner, he glances back down the street, but the street
is empty. The Young Man looks around thoughtfully before
hurrying off around the corner.
The Young Man rushes through the crowded streets, not quite
running but faster then we’ve seen him move before.
The YOUNG MAN rushes into Charing Cross station and stands
across from the left-luggage office, waiting breathlessly.
Commuters stream across the station, obscuring his view of
the office.
Through a gap in the flow of people the Young Man catches a
glimpse of Dark Suit. The Young Man moves closer, wading
through commuters to get a better look.
He sees Dark Suit hand over his ticket and pick up his first
overnight bag.
4.
Dark Suit slings one bag over each shoulder before heading
off through the station towards the back entrance on to
Hungerford Bridge.
The Young Man follows. They cross the footbridge, trains
rumbling past on the right-hand side, the sky darkening.
They pass through the South Bank Centre and head south,
entering residential streets as it gets dark. Dark Suit
arrives at a small block of flats and lets himself in. The
Young Man sees a light come on in a third-floor window. He
makes a not of the address, turns and walks away.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): It was the most important rule, so
it was the one I broke last.
FADE TO BLACK.:

EXT. ROW OF TERRACED TOWNHOUSES - DUSK

The Young Man looks up at a second-floor window. His
appearance is dramatically different from the preceding
scene: his hair is in a short, ragged near crew-cut, and he
now wears an old-fashioned dark suit and tie.
The Young Man walks past the row of houses then doubles back
on the opposite side, stopping at a bus stop from which he
can see the houses, He reaches into the inside pocket of his
jacket and takes out a strip of passport photos. He stares at
them, and we see that they are of a young blonde woman,
perhaps  the same woman who drew the curtains.
One of the front doors opens and the young blonde woman
exits. The Young Man glaces at the photos in his hand - it is
the same young woman.
The Blonde comes out on to the street. She is wearing a long
overcoat, a purse under her arm.
The Young Man lets her get slightly ahead before tailing her
from the opposite side of the street. The Blonde strides
purposefully ahead, not looking around.
As they enter a more crowded West End street, the Young Man
allows himself to cross onto the same side and move ever
closer.
The Blonde glides through the other pedestrians gracefully
and easily behind her the Young Man bobs and weaves to keep
her in sight.
5.

EXT. SMALL ENTRANCE TO A BASEMENT BAR/CLUB - DUSK

The Young Man approaches and stops outside. The passport
photos are still in his hand. He glances at them as he
replaces them in his inside pocket. He looks at the stairs
down into the club, looks around, rubbing his face.
FADE TO BLACK.:

EXT. STREET IN SOHO - DAY

The Young Man walks down the street, following a middle-aged
bald man. The Young Man has short hair and is wearing a suit
and tie. He is wearing sunglasses and his lip looks swollen.
Baldy stops and turns into a doorway.
The Young Man comes up and examines the names by the bells.
They are all companies/offices.
He looks around, crosses the road and slips into a cafe.

INT. CAFÉ - DAY

The café is empty apart from a woman on her own reading a
book at one of the tables.
The Young Man buys a coffee at the counter and heads over to
the table nearest the window. He sips at his coffee and
glances out of the window to the building opposite.
He takes his dark glasses off and examines his reflection in
the blade of the knife that was sitting on the table. His
left eye is horribly bruised and swollen - it looks half-
closed. There is a plaster above it, across the eyebrow. His
lip is swollen and marked where it has been recently split.
The Young Man looks up and sees that the lone woman is
staring at him. He puts his sunglasses back on and we:
FADE TO BLACK.:

EXT. OUTSIDE A BLOCK OF FLATS IN THE WEST END - DAY

The Young Man stares up at the building, perplexed.
Dark Suit comes out of the building, a sports bag slung over
his shoulder. As he walks down the street the Young Man
follows, the throng of people washing around them.
Dark Suit dives into a café.
6.
The Young Man comes abreast of it and looks through the
window. The café is crowded; Dark Suit has taken a table near
the back, facing away from the door. The Young Man looks
about, takes a deep breath and pushes open the door to the
café.

INT. CAFÉ - DAY

Five or six tables, mostly occupied. Two men behind the
counter making the food, one waitress squeezing between the
tables.
The Young Man enters. Keeping an eye on Dark Suit’s back, the
Young Man slides behind a table.
WAITRESS: Yeah?
YOUNG MAN: Coffee, black.
WAITRESS: You’re going to take up one of my
tables over lunch with just a
coffee?
YOUNG MAN: And chips.
He looks up at the waitress; she’s still there.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): And an omlette... please.
The Waitress turns and leaves.
The Young Man looks over to Dark Suit. The sports bag rests
besides Dark Suit’s feet. Dark Suit eats, we can’t see what.
The waitress brings the Young Man’s food. He plays with it as
he considers Dark Suit.
The Young Man gulps at his coffee. Time passes, the other
tables change.
Dark Suit gets up, picks up his bag and turns around, moving
towards the Young Man.
The Young Man studies his half-eaten omelette intently.
DARK SUIT (O.S.): Mind if I join you?
7.
The Young Man looks up; Dark Suit is at his elbow, smiling.
Dark Suit sits down without waiting for a reply.
DARK SUIT (CONT’D): (matter-of-fact)
Who and why?
The Young Man looks confused. The Waitress is at their table.
DARK SUIT (CONT’D): (to Waitress)
Another black coffee for me and...
(to the Young Man)
... What are you having?
The Young Man  shakes his head and starts to murmur
negatives. Dark Suit reaches over, picks up the Young Man’s
empty mug and sniffs it.
DARK SUIT (CONT’D): (to Waitress)
And another coffee...
(he looks into the mug)
... also black.
The Waitress leaves. Dark Suit stares at the Young Man who is
having trouble returning his gaze.
DARK SUIT (CONT’D): You’re obviously not a policeman,
so who are you and why are you
following me?
The Young Man half-smiles as if he has not understood the
question, then glances from side to side in an attempt to
look uncomprehending.
YOUNG MAN: I’m sorry?
DARK SUIT: You’ve been following me all
morning... why?
YOUNG MAN: Following? I’m sorry but I’ve
absolutely no idea what you’re
talking about-
DARK SUIT: (aggressive)
Don’t piss me off. Who the fuck are
you?
8.
The Young Man can’t think of anything to say. An
uncomfortable silence broken by the Waitress bringing two
coffees.
DARK SUIT (CONT’D): (to Waitress, eyes still
on Young Man)
Thanks.
(to Young Man)
Sugar?
The Young Man shakes his head. Dark Suit breaks eye contact
to spoon two sugars into his coffee. He stirs it noisily,
looking up expectantly, waiting for the Young Man to speak.
The Young Man’ mouth opens and closes silently several times
before he speaks.
YOUNG MAN: Look I’m not... I haven’t been
following you, I just I just saw
you with your bag and I thought you
looked... interesting.
DARK SUIT: What are you, a faggot?
YOUNG MAN: No! No, I, I, I, I’m a... Look I
saw you on the street and, and you
reminded me of someone I went to
school with- to tell the truth I
thought you were him, so I followed
you and came in here- I came in
here ‘cos I was hungry- but I
wanted to see if it was him...
Dark Suit stares at him.
YOUNG MAN(CONT’D): (fading)
... but it wasn’t.
DARK SUIT: Why didn’t you just ask me when you
saw me?
YOUNG MAN: I would’ve been embarrassed.
DARK SUIT: (smiling)
Not as embarrassed as you are now.
9.
YOUNG MAN: (laughing nervously)
No, I suppose not.
Dark Suit sips at his coffee. The Young Man follows suit.
DARK SUIT: What’s your name?
YOUNG MAN: Bill.
Dark Suit smiles.
DARK SUIT: Well, ‘Bill’... what do you do?
YOUNG MAN: Actually, I’m kind of-
DARK SUIT: ‘Between jobs right now.’
YOUNG MAN: That’s right.
DARK SUIT: What would you do?
YOUNG MAN: I don’t know.
DARK SUIT: (smiling)
Don’t be coy, ‘Bill’. There must be
some burning ambition eating away
at you. You look like some kind of
starving artist?
YOUNG MAN: No.
DARK SUIT: No?
YOUNG MAN: No.
DARK SUIT: Painter?
YOUNG MAN: No.
10.
DARK SUIT: Photos?
YOUNG MAN: No.
DARK SUIT: Films?
YOUNG MAN: No.
DARK SUIT: Writer?
YOUNG MAN: (slight pause)
No.
DARK SUIT: Writer.
YOUNG MAN:
NO.:
DARK SUIT: But you write?
YOUNG MAN: Not really.
DARK SUIT: But sometimes?
YOUNG MAN: Sometimes, who doesn’t?
DARK SUIT: Me.
(pause)
So you’re a writer.
YOUNG MAN: I didn’t say that. What makes you
think that I’m a writer anyway?
DARK SUIT: Educated, unemployed
twentysomething, fancies himself a
writer... a real leap into the
unknown.
YOUNG MAN: Well, I’m not a writer.
11.
DARK SUIT: But you’re interested in people.
YOUNG MAN: Yeah.
DARK SUIT: This person?
YOUNG MAN: I suppose -
DARK SUIT: You haven’t even asked my name.
YOUNG MAN: What’s your -
DARK SUIT: Or what’s in my bag.
YOUNG MAN: Bag?
DARK SUIT: (gestures at his feet)
My bag. The one you’ve been staring
at.
There is a pause during which Dark Suit stares challengingly
at the Young Man, who looks thoughtfully, undecided.
YOUNG MAN: (sighing)
What’s your name and what’s in your
bag?
Dark Suit smiles, and reaches down for his bag.
DARK SUIT: (dumps bag on table)
My name’s Cobb. Take a look for
yourself.
The Young Man pauses, then, eyes on Cobb, he reaches forward
and pulls the bag across the table. He unzips it and peers
inside.
The Young Man looks puzzled. Cobb grins.
Inside the bag are CDs. Rummaging beneath them the Young Man
uncovers some jewelry and a camera. He looks up at Cobb,
puzzled.
12.
COBB: (smilING)
What were you expecting, drugs?
YOUNG MAN: They’re yours?
COBB: (laughing)
They are now.
YOUNG MAN: Why would you take their old CDs?
COBB: Easy to grab a load, easy to sell,
totally untraceable. A good staple.
The other stuff’s more tricky, far
more unpredictable.
YOUNG MAN: You don’t look like a burglar.
COBB: Sounds like a compliment.
The Young Man shrugs and smiles, zipping up the bag.
COBB (CONT’D): (grinning broadly)
Interested now?
FADE TO BLACK.:

EXT. ENTRANCE TO A BASEMENT BAR/CLUB - DUSK

The Blonde approaches, pauses, looking behind herself as if
suspicious of being followed. She goes down the stairs into
the club.
The Young Man (short hair, clean shaven) approaches the
entrance, pauses, uncertain. He looks about, then dives in.

INT. BASEMENT BAR/CLUB - DUSK

Three-sided bar, booths and tables, music.
The Young Man enters. The place is not full. The Blonde is
seated at the bar. She watches the Young Man comes in, then
looks away, uninterested.
13.
The Young Man approaches the bar, leaning on it several
places along from The Blonde, glancing at her out of the
corner of his eye. She is oblivious to his presence, as is
the bartender, who is on the phone behind the bar. The Young
Man sneaks looks at The Blonde whilst tapping the bar,
waiting for the bartender to hang up the phone. The Blonde
has an elegant profile, as seen from along the bar, but she
looks unhappy.
The bartender hangs up the phone, shuffles over and looks
enquiringly at the Young Man.
YOUNG MAN: Beer.
The bartender grabs a bottle from the fridge, opens it and
sets it down in front of the Young Man. The bartender holds
up a glass and raises his eyebrows at the Young Man, who
shakes his head and raises the bottle to his lips, taking a
sip. The Young Man puts the bottle back on the bar and turns
to look at The Blonde. He gets off his barstool and moves
down towards her, sliding his beer along the bar as he goes.
He stops at her side.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): Buy you a drink?
THE BLONDE: (staring ahead)
Yeah, but you can’t sleep with me.
The Young Man smiles quizzically.
YOUNG MAN: Why not?
The Blonde turns to look at him, a movement of the head,
nothing else, her expression hard to read.
THE BLONDE: I’m with him.
She jerks her head behind them. The Young Man turns, seeing
three men seated at a table across the room, papers on the
table, apparently talking business. Suits, ties, two of them
young, one middle-aged and bald.
YOUNG MAN: (turning back)
Not that bald one?
THE BLONDE: He’ll let you buy me a drink, but
sex is out of the question.
14.
YOUNG MAN: I see.
THE BLONDE: Still want to buy me that drink?
YOUNG MAN: No.
Right answer, The Blonde laughs. The Young Man sips from his
beer.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): So what’s a beautiful young woman
like you doing -
THE BLONDE: In a place like this?
YOUNG MAN: - with a bald old cunt like that.
THE BLONDE: Long story. Keep your voice down,
he owns this place.
YOUNG MAN: Just trying to get your attention.
You’re interested now aren’t you?
THE BLONDE: (turning away)
No.
The Young Man is disarmed. He looks at the label of his beer
for something to say.
YOUNG MAN: I’m Timothy Kerr - Tim to my
friends.
THE BLONDE: (without looking at him)
So?
The Young Manopens his mouth, pissed off, but changes his
mind before he speaks.
YOUNG MAN: (softly)
You’ve obviously had a bad day, one
of those days which makes you feel
that everybody’s out for their
pound of flesh.
15.
The Blonde turns to look at him, her expression softer, but
not much.
THE BLONDE: (slow, considered
delivery)
That is the kind of day I’ve been
having lately.
She glances out of the corner of her towards Baldy. He is
watching them.
THE BLONDE (CONT’D): (looking back to Young
Man)
Say something to me.
YOUNG MAN: Such as?
The Blonde slaps the Young Man hard across the face. He looks
shocked.
THE BLONDE: (turning to her drink)
I’ll be outside in ten minutes.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO BASEMENT BAR/CLUB - NIGHT

The Young Man is loitering outside.
The Blonde comes up out of the club and walks towards the
Young Man without appearing even to notice him. He falls into
step beside her. They don’t speak for several paces.
THE BLONDE: Live close?
YOUNG MAN: Yeah. You live, I mean, you do you
live around here?
THE BLONDE: I do. But I don’t want to go back
there.
YOUNG MAN: Because of the bald guy.
THE BLONDE: No.
16.
YOUNG MAN: You want to go to my place?
THE BLONDE: (laughing)
Don’t get your hopes up. I can’t be
seen with you in any of the bars
around here. Got anything to drink
at home?
YOUNG MAN: We can stop on the way.
FADE TO BLACK.:

INT. CAFÉ - DAY

The Young Man sits alone at a table by the window, watching
the building opposite. He has short hair and wears sunglasses
to hide the worst of his facial bruises, but his swollen lip
is still noticeable.
In front of him on the table are a cup of coffee, a notebook
and a pen. He sips at the coffee.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Young Man’s POV from the café. Baldy exits the building and

The Young Man opens the notebook and writes in it, and we:
FADE TO BLACK.:

INT. OUTSIDE THE DOOR TO A FLAT, THE LANDING OF A NARROW

STAIRWAY - DAY: Cobb comes up the stairs and stops outside the door.
The Young Man (he has long hair and is unshaven) follows,
standing behind Cobb, looking over Cobb’s shoulder as he
examines the door.
Cobb knocks gingerly on the door. After a pause, he reaches
into his jacket pocket and pulls out a pair of rubber
surgical gloves. He inflates the gloves one after the other
before putting them on, interlacing his fingers and bumping
the gloves snugly into place. He turns to the Young Man.
17.
COBB: (whispering)
Gloves?
The YOUNG MAN nods and holds up his hands for inspection- he
is wearing thick, leather and wool gloves.
Cobb rolls his eyes. Shaking his head, he turns back to the
door, then pushes the Young Man back and lifts up the
doormat. There’s nothing under there, and he lets it back
down. The Young Man leans forward to whisper into Cobb’s ear.
YOUNG MAN: (whispering)
People don’t really do that, do
they?
COBB: (whispering, reaching into
his pocket)
You’d be surprised.
He takes a piece of plastic out and starts working it into
the crack between the door and the frame.
The Young Man notices a potted plant on the windmill. He
reaches over and shifts it slightly, finding a key underneath
it. He taps Cobb on the shoulder and when he turns around the
Young Man holds it up in front of his face. COBB smiles as he
grabs it, and turns back to the door to unlock it.
COBB (CONT’D): (whispering)
Beginner’s luck.
Cobb opens the door and heads inside, the Young Man
following.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

No lights - cold grey daylight filtered through net curtains.
Cobb is first, creeping forward through the flat with the
Young Man at his shoulder. Cobb looks left and right into
doorways as they advance, pushing them open gently to see
inside to let more light into the hallway. At the end of the
hall Cobb turns to face the Young Man.
COBB: (speaking normally now)
See, nobody home. Right, first
things first. We need a bag.
18.
YOUNG MAN: (whispering)
A bag?
COBB: To carry the stuff out of here. Why
are you whispering?
Cobb passes through a door off to the left.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

A futon, two wardrobes, piles of books and neatly folded
clothes by the wall. Cobb crosses the room to the first
wardrobe and opens it, rummaging around the bottom.
COBB: (head in wardrobe)
Bingo.
COBB backs out of the wardrobe clutching a soft overnight
bag.
YOUNG MAN: (not whispering, but still
quiet)
Don’t you have your own?
COBB: Yeah, sure, it’s a big bag with
‘swag’ written across the side.
OK... what do you fancy?
The Young Man looks around and shrugs.
COBB (CONT’D): Not much is here of any value.
YOUNG MAN: You don’t seem too concerned.
COBB: I don’t do it for the money.
YOUNG MAN: So why-
COBB: For the adrenalin, and because,
like you, I’m interested in people.
The Young Man raises his eyebrows.
19.
COBB (CONT’D): You can tell a lot about people
from their stuff. How old would you
say these people were?
The Young Man shrugs.
COBB (CONT’D): Well, just from the futon you can
make a pretty good guess. Young
people have futons. I’d be
surprised if they were anywhere
near forty with a futon. But
they’ve got one laundry bag so
they’re used to each other which
makes me thing that they’re over
twenty-five.
YOUNG MAN: But if they’re only twenty they
could have been living together for
years.
COBB: Look at the books. They’re educated-
went to college, graduated when
they were twenty-one or twenty-two,
wouldn’t have moved in with each
other until at least the last year
of college. Get a better idea from
their music.
He starts to examine the shelves, running surgeon’s fingers
across the shelves, touching things without picking them up.
He comes across a wooden box.
COBB (CONT’D): Here’s the box.
YOUNG MAN: What box?
COBB: Everybody’s got a box. With men
it’s usually a shoebox.
YOUNG MAN: With valuable inside?
COBB: No. More interesting, more
personal. Letters, odd snapshots, a
plastic toy out of a Christmas
cracker, a pebble from some beach.
20.
He opens the box. The Young Man looks over his shoulder.
COBB (CONT’D): (picking through the
contents)
See? Photos, odd bits of paper,
worthless plastic jewelry. An
unconscious collection. A display.
YOUNG MAN: Display?
COBB: Yes, a display. Each object showing
something about the person,
together adding up to an
illustration of their personality.
We’ve all got something of the
artist inside of us, even if it is
unconscious. It’s extremely
personal. We’re privileged to see
it. People rarely show anyone their
box.
Cobb stares lovingly at the contents of the box for a few
seconds before suddenly throwing it across the room, spilling
the contents everywhere with surprising violence.
YOUNG MAN: (taken aback)
It’s like a diary. They hide it,
but secretly they want someone to
look at it and that’s what I do.
Concealment, display; flip sides of
the same coin. This way they know
that someone’s seen it. That’s what
it’s all about, interrupting
someone’s life, making them think
about all the things they usually
take for granted. That’s what
you’re doing when you steal their
things. When they collect the
insurance money they go out and buy
all these things that have just
been sitting on their shelves,
stuff they’d forgotten they’d
bought, and they have to think all
over again about why they wanted
this stuff, what it’s for. You take
it away and show them what they
had.
21.
He moves to the laundry bag, and reaches into his pocket. He
pulls out a pair of lace panties, holding them up for the
Young Man to see.
COBB: Saucy, eh? I took them from the
last place, two young women sharing
a flat.
The Young Man looks totally baffled as Cobb reaches into the
laundry bag and pulls out a pair of trousers. He stuffs the
panties into the front left pocket and sticks the trousers
back into the bag. COBB heads towards the door, passing the
baffled Young Man.
COBB (CONT’D): (winking)
Give ‘em something to chat about.
Cobb leaves the bedroom. The Young Man follows.

INT. HALLWAY - DAT

Cobb walks down the corridor carrying the bag, the Young Man
behind him.
YOUNG MAN: Why did you do that?
COBB: (over his shoulder)
She’ll find them in his trousers
and want to know what he’s been up
to.
YOUNG MAN: Why would you want to fuck up their
relationship?
Cobb spins about to face the YOUNG MAN so abruptly that they
almost collide. There is a manic look in his eyes.
COBB: (deadly serious)
Don’t you listen? You take it away
and show them what they had.
The Young Man is speechless. Cobb turns and from in front of
him we can see a mischievous grin break across his face which
is hidden from the Young Man. Cobb dives through a doorway.
The Young Man shakes his head and heads after him.
22.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Cobb is taking two glasses down from the cupboard. There is a
bottle of red wine on the counter.
The Young Man enters.
COBB: Fancy a drink?
The Young Man looks at the bottle then at Cobb.
YOUNG MAN: You’ve got to be joking.
COBB: (rummaging in a drawer)
Don’t be fooled by the supermarket
label - its quite good, I’ve had it
before.
He takes a corkscrew out of the drawer and starts to open the
bottle, his hands smooth and graceful - surgical, almost - in
their white latex sheaths.
COBB (CONT’D): (levering the cork out)
You’d have trouble doing this with
your gloves on.
He places the corkscrew on the counter and pours two glasses
of wine, handing one to the Young Man who sips at it. Cobb
picks up the corkscrew and starts to remove the cork from it.
YOUNG MAN: So are we going to take anything?
COBB: (placing the corkscrew
back into the drawer)
Anything your heart desires. But
look, that’s not the point, that’s
just work. This is what it’s all
about- being here. Entering
someone’s life, finding out who
they are... just feel it- standing
in someone’s kitchen, drinking
their wine, someone you’ll never
even meet.
He jams the cork into the neck of the bottle and sticks it up
on the shelf.
23.
Just as he does so there is the unmistakable sound of the
front door being opened.
Cobb spins around to face the kitchen door. The Young Man
throws his glass down onto the counter.
We hear a muffled voice through the door.
WOMAN (O.S.): Drink? I’ve got some wine.
MAN (O.S.): Why not?
Cobb stands frozen, tense, staring at the door. The Young Man
looks terrified, glancing from the back of Cobb’s head to the
door and back.
YOUNG MAN: (tense whisper)
What the fuck do-
COBB: (hissing)
SHHHHH!: The door swings open and Cobb’s face transforms into an
expression of innocent surprise. A young Woman stands frozen
in the doorway. Cobb steps forward, palms open.
COBB (CONT’D): (friendly, relaxed)
You startled us! From the agency or
viewing, like us?
As he speaks he has moved right up to the Woman, coming close
enough that she feels compelled to step back into the hall.
The Young Man follows, still looking nervous, but the Woman’s
attention is on Cobb.
WOMAN: (tense, confused)
What are you doing in my flat?

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The Woman comes into the hall followed by the Young Man. Cobb
turns his attention to the older man who stands frozen in the
hall, looking as nervous as the Young Man.
24.
COBB: (to the woman)
Viewing it. The agent said you’d be
out this afternoon.
WOMAN: (bewildered)
But we’re not moving.
COBB: (to older man, ignoring
Woman)
You must be the man of the house.
You have a lovely home.
The older man looks nervously to the Woman. The Young Man and
Cobb are both now at the door.
COBB (CONT’D): We’ll leave you in peace, then.
WOMAN: But we’re not moving!
COBB: (opening door, looks
bewildered)
Not even at the end of the month?
WOMAN:
NO!: The woman notices their gloves.
Cobb notices her noticing.
COBB: (motioning the young man
out the door)
I should check with the agent,
then, Luv. Sorry to have bothered
you.
Cobb leaves, closing the door in the couple’s bewildered
faces.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

The Young Man comes out of a doorway onto the flat roof,
hurrying, followed by Cobb. Cobb closes the door behind him.
25.
COBB: Shouldn’t have come back up here.
We’ll have to wait ages before we
go down. Maybe there’s another way
off here.
Cobb starts to look around the edges of the roof.
YOUNG MAN: Jesus shit. You think they believed
you?
COBB: (laughing)
Of course they didn’t fucking
believe me!
YOUNG MAN: So what did-
COBB: I just confused them. We caught
them on the hop.
YOUNG MAN: How do you mean?
COBB: That bloke wasn’t the boyfriend.
Why do you think he didn’t say
anything? They were up to no good
and was probably glad that we
weren’t her boyfriend.
YOUNG MAN: You reckon?
COBB: Definitely. Why else would she be
home from work in the middle of the
afternoon? You just can’t plan for
that kind of shit, we were unlucky.
Don’t be put off. It’s not going to
happen next time.
YOUNG MAN: I’m not so sure.
COBB: (offended)
Oh yeah? Well next time you can do
the prep work.
26.
YOUNG MAN: I didn’t mean that-
COBB: I’m serious. You pick a mark, check
it out to your own satisfaction
days, months, years, whatever- and
that’s what we’ll hit next.
YOUNG MAN: (thoughtfully)
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
COBB: Tell you what.
YOUNG MAN: What?
COBB: I feel bad about pulling the panty
routine on that bloke- she’ll give
him a load of shit, and it’s her
that’s screwing around.
The Young Man laughs, releasing tension.
FADE TO BLACK.:

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Small, eclectic mix of stuff. Rubber plant, portable TV,
desk, portable stereo. The Blonde circles the room slowly,
looking at various items, her overcoat still on.
The Young Man enters (he has short hair and is clean-shaven),
carrying two glasses.
The Blonde hasn’t heard him come in. He watches her from the
doorway as she reaches out to touch a ceramic candlestick
sitting on a shoulder-high shelf. As she touches the
candlestick it falls into two pieces. As she grabs at them
she notices the Young Man watching her.
THE BLONDE: (flustered)
I’m sorry, I just touched it, it -
YOUNG MAN: Just came apart in you hands.
THE BLONDE: No, really, it did.
27.
The Young Man smiles as he moves into the room.
YOUNG MAN: I know, it was already broken.
Somebody dropped it, I was going to
glue it...
He grabs two pieces, putting the glasses down on the shelf in
their place.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): ... But sod it, I’ll never get
around to it.
He drops the pieces into a waste-paper basket.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): (gesturing at chair)
Take a seat.
The Blonde perches on the edge of a chair, her coat still on.
The Young Man takes a bottle out of a plastic bag, opens it
and pours two measures. He hands The Blonde a drink. She sips
at it. She looks cold.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): So what about the bald guy?
THE BLONDE: What about him?
YOUNG MAN: You’re going out with him.
THE BLONDE: Not exactly.
YOUNG MAN: But you and him are -
THE BLONDE: (matter-of-factly)
I used to have a thing going with
him, but it’s been over for a long
time.
YOUNG MAN: So why did you tell me you were
with him?
THE BLONDE: To get rid of you.
28.
YOUNG MAN: (grins)
So when you decided to have a drink
with me, why did we have to come
here?
THE BLONDE: He still gets jealous, he’s a
dangerous person. And I don’t want
to go to my place right now.
YOUNG MAN: (probing)
Why not?
THE BLONDE: I was burgled yesterday.
YOUNG MAN: Really? What did it feel like, to
find your place broken into?
THE BLONDE: That’s an odd question. Most people
ask ‘What did they take?’
YOUNG MAN: I’m curious about the way people
feel about things.
He moves to the desk, reaching at a black case which sits
amidst the papers and assorted crap.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): I’m a writer.
(opening the case to
reveal an ancient manual
typewriter)
See?
THE BLONDE: (deadpan)
Gosh.
YOUNG MAN: So?
THE BLONDE: So?
YOUNG MAN: How did it feel?
29.
THE BLONDE: (annoyed)
Great. How do you think it felt? I
don’t really want to talk about it,
thank you.
The Young Man shrugs.
YOUNG MAN: Sorry.
He straddles the chair which is in front of the desk. He
leans in towards The Blonde.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): So the bald guy’s dangerous?
THE BLONDE: (laughing)
Christ, you’re a nosy bastard.
YOUNG MAN: Dangerous like how?
THE BLONDE: Dangerous like criminal type,
involved with bad things type
dangerous.
YOUNG MAN: What sort of bad things?
THE BLONDE: The usual: girls, drugs, magazines.
YOUNG MAN: Magazines?
THE BLONDE: And films... pornography. And he
owns a couple of clubs.
YOUNG MAN: Wealthy?
THE BLONDE: Yes. And refined. It took me a long
time to realize the sort of things
which he was capable of.
YOUNG MAN: What sort of things?
30.
THE BLONDE: Perhaps another time. I think I’d
better be going.
FADE TO BLACK.:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Young Man stands at the window, watching people pass by
on the street below. He has short hair and his face is badly
bruised.
He picks up the telephone and dials a number. After a few
rings, the phone is answered by a man we might recognize as
Cobb.
COBB (O.S.): Yeah?
YOUNG MAN: It’s me... Bill.
COBB (O.S.): What the fuck do you want?
YOUNG MAN: Advice.
A pause.
COBB (O.S.): On what?
YOUNG MAN: The job.
COBB (O.S.): What fucking job?
YOUNG MAN: The one I asked you about.
COBB (O.S.): Not interested.
YOUNG MAN: (snorting)
I gathered that. I’m doing it on my
own. I wondered about protection.
COBB (O.S.): Protection?
31.
YOUNG MAN: Self-defence, weapon of some sort.
Surprisingly enough, I thought you
might be able to advise.
Cobb laughs at the other end of the phone.
COBB (O.S.): Steel whip, nun-chucks - they’re
all right. Tools are good: sharpened screwdriver, hammer,
chisel -
YOUNG MAN: Hammer?
COBB (O.S.): Yeah, medium size, good rubber grip
- very nasty. Get a claw hammer you
can pry doors with it. Slip it into
the back of your waistband, you’re
set.
The Young Man’s eyes have glazed over - he doesn’t seem to be
listening.
COBB (O.S.) (CONT’D): You still there?
The Young Man hangs up without a word and we:
FADE TO BLACK.:

EXT. OUTSIDE THE DOOR TO A FLAT - DAY

Cobb and the Young Man (he has long hair and is unshaven) are
putting on their gloves.
Cobb looks at the Young Man’s leather gloves.
COBB: Why don’t you get some of these,
for Christ’s sake?
YOUNG MAN: Where do you get them?
COBB: Stole a box from the Middlesex
Hospital, but you can buy them.
He bends down and checks under the doormat. He straightens,
up holding a key.
32.
COBB (CONT’D): Bing-fucking-go.
He unlocks the door and they step cautiously inside.

INT. DIMLY LIT HALLWAY OF THE FLAT - DAY

Cobb proceeds slowly down the hall, pushing open each
interior door and checking the various rooms. He stops at the
last door.
COBB: You find a bag, I’ll check out the
stuff.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

A small room with an eclectic mix of stuff, rubber plant,
portable TV, desk, portable stereo.
Cobb enters and circles around the room, running his gloved
hands across the mantelpiece, rubber-plant leaves, etc.
The Young Man enters, carrying a sports bag.
YOUNG MAN: Here we go.
COBB: (almost to himself)
That was quick. We may not need
it...
(he looks at the Young
Man)
... there’s fuck-all here.
Tight on the Young Man’s face; he’s really interested.
YOUNG MAN: Oh?
COBB: (sarcastic)
Oh.
The Young Man looks around. Cobb prowls around the room
dangerously.
YOUNG MAN: What about the stereo?
33.
Cobb has stopped at some shelves. Near his shoulder is a
ceramic candlestick, no candle in it.
COBB: How much would you pay for a second-
hand, ten-year-old portable stereo?
You want to carry it, you can have
it. This is fucking useless.
He tips the candlestick off the shelf and on to the floor. It
breaks in two when it hits the floor.
YOUNG MAN: (surprised)
Hey, what are we - vandals or
burglars?
COBB: You’re a burglar? So burgle.
YOUNG MAN: Well... what about the CDs?
Cobb crosses to the small CD rack.
COBB: (interested now)
Not much of a collection.
YOUNG MAN: (drawing him out)
Oh?
COBB: (flipping through CDs)
Very little here. And what there is
seems quite personal.
YOUNG MAN: How’s that?
COBB: There’s none of the music that
people play when their friends come
round, you know, not to be listened
to or even noticed but to fill in
gaps in conversation.
YOUNG MAN: Like what?
COBB: (glances around room)
For someone this age...
34.
(MORE): I dunno, maybe Simply Red or
Fleetwood Mac, that sort of shit.
YOUNG MAN: He’s got good taste.
Cobb moves over to the desk.
COBB: Each to his own. But he’s a sad
fucker with no social life.
The Young Man raises his eyebrows. At the desk Cobb flips
open a black case to reveal an ancient typewriter.
COBB (CONT’D): Nice machine.
YOUNG MAN: You think he’s a writer?
COBB: (scoffing)
If he wanted to write he’d have a
word processor. He doesn’t want to
write, he wants to be a writer -
and that’s two...
(notices something)
... two completely different
things.
(turns to Young Man)
You check this out, right?
YOUNG MAN: Right.
COBB: (suspicious)
You watched him come and go, saw
his routine?
YOUNG MAN: (defensive)
I told you, I checked it out. Why?
Cobb turns to the desk and stares at it, hard.
COBB: This guy’s unemployed.
YOUNG MAN: No he isn’t.
35.
COBB (CONT'D):
COBB: (emphatic)
He’s unemployed. Look at this desk,
people with jobs don’t want this
shit in their living rooms!
(rummaging through papers,
files)
This guy is unemployed or a
student... either way he could be
back any fucking second!
YOUNG MAN: (concerned)
Hw won’t. I watched him come and
go, he’s got a job.
COBB: (rummaging)
Yeah? What’s he do, then?
YOUNG MAN: (insistent)
I checked it out.
Cobb stops rummaging, turns around and glares at the Young
Man.
COBB: (malevolent)
What the fuck is this, then?
He holds up a booklet.
COBB (CONT’D): (controlled anger)
You should recognize this, Dole-
boy...
(steps forward)
... his fucking UB40.
He grabs the Young Man and throws him against the wall.
He holds the Young Man’s face with his left hand and slaps
the booklet across with the other, hard.
COBB (CONT’D): Checked it out! You fucking
arsehole, are you trying to get us
thrown in jail? We’re leaving now.
He releases the Young Man, staring at him fro a few seconds
before walking out of the living room. The Young Man rubs his
face before following.
36.

INT. HALL - DAY

The Young man hurtles after Cobb, who is almost at the front
door.
YOUNG MAN: Aren’t we going to take anything?
COBB: We’re going now. I don’t steal from
no-hope dole scroungers. No
offence.
YOUNG MAN: (to himself)
None taken.
Cobb opens the front door and turns to face the approaching
Young Man.
COBB: There’s another place. One that
I’ve checked out...
They leave, closing the door behind them.
FADE TO BLACK.:

EXT. ROW OF TERRACED TOWNHOUSES - DAY

The Young Man (with short hair and clean-shaven) loiters at
the bus stop, watching The Blonde’s second floor windows. The
curtains are pulled back to reveal The Blonde. She stands at
the window. The front door opens and Baldy steps out.
The Young Man watches Baldy as he walks down the steps on to
the street and turns right, away from the Young Man.
The Young Man waits for a few seconds before walking up to
the front door and ringing The Blonde’s buzzer. The front
door clicks unlocked and the Young Man heads inside.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE BLONDE’S FLAT - DAY

The Young Man comes up to the door and knocks; the door
pushes open slightly with the force of the knock.
THE BLONDE (O.S.): (from within)
It’s open!
The Young Man enters.
37.

INT. HALL OF A LARGE APARTMENT - DAY

Noise of a shower running, steam coming out of an open
doorway.
The Young Man comes down the hall, cautiously. The Blonde
comes out of a doorway in a bathrobe, glances at him.
THE BLONDE: You’re early.
She disappears into the bathroom before the Young Man has a
chance to reply.
THE BLONDE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Make yourself at home, I’ll be a
minute.
The Young Man comes down the corridor. As he comes past the
bathroom he sees that she has only half-closed the door - he
peers in, but sees only a towel rail and steam. He goes
through the next doorway along.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Expensively and tastefully decorated, almost cluttered - some
pictures on the walls, lots of plants.
The Young Man comes into the room, glances around. He moves
over to a small table by the wall and looks down at it. There
is nothing on it. He runs his fingers over the polished wood
surface, then turns around, looking about the room for
something that he can’t find. He crosses the room and sits
down in a large armchair near the windows.
The Blonde enters, still in her robe, rubbing her wet hair
with a towel.
YOUNG MAN: Nice place.
THE BLONDE: (sitting down on the
couch)
Thanks. I can’t stand the idea that
some stranger was in here,
rummaging around. Creepy.
YOUNG MAN: What’d they take?
38.
THE BLONDE: CD player, CDs, stuff like that.
They took one of my bags to carry
it in - the police told me that
that’s pretty standard.
YOUNG MAN: Must be bad - losing that stuff.
THE BLONDE: (shrugging)
Insurance’ll cover it. The personal
stuff was worse.
YOUNG MAN: Personal stuff?
THE BLONDE: They took some of my things. They
rifled through my underwear.
YOUNG MAN: Probably thought you kept your
valuables hidden there.
THE BLONDE: (shaking her head with
evident distaste)
They took some of it.
YOUNG MAN: Shit. Why would they do that?
THE BLONDE: (mocking)
Come on, don’t play the innocent,
you’re a man - you know the sort of
kinky voyeuristic shit men get up
to.
YOUNG MAN: (shaking his head)
No. No, no, no... I’m not into that
kind of...
THE BLONDE: So you have no interest in women’s
underwear whatsover?
YOUNG MAN: No. I’m interested in what’s inside
it, that’s all.
39.
THE BLONDE: So if I offered you a pair of my
panties, you wouldn’t be remotely
interested?
YOUNG MAN: ‘Fraid not, though I’m sure they’re
lovely. Now you’ve embarrassed me
enough, thanks.
THE BLONDE: (shrugging)
Well, they took some. I’ll tell you
what else, they took one of my
earrings - not the pair, just one
of the earrings. Bloody annoying.
YOUNG MAN: Maybe you’ve just misplaced it.
THE BLONDE: No. I know where it was - they took
it... just to fuck me around.
Bloody annoying, they probably
thing they’re really clever. I wear
the one they left on its own.
YOUNG MAN: Why?
THE BLONDE: (shrugs)
Makes me feel good and miserable. I
don’t know, gives me something to
talk about, anyway.
She sighs and looks over to the window.
THE BLONDE (CONT’D): (rising)
Give me a minute, I’ll get dressed.
She leaves. As soon as she is out of the room the Young Man
jumps out of his chair and lifts up the seat cushion, looking
underneath. He thrusts his hands down the back and sides of
the chair, feeling for something. He comes up empty-handed,
puzzlement on his face, and replaces the cushion.
He goes into the hall and crosses to another doorway.
40.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The Young Man pauses at the door. It is open a crack and
through the crack he can see into the bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

The Young Man’s POV through the crack shows us The Blonde
almost dressed, buttoning her blouse in front of the mirror.
The Young Man watches for a second or two, then pushes the
door open quietly.
The Blonde turns her head to look at him, apparently
unsurprised. The Young Man moves towards her. She allows him
to reach out and pull her towards him. He kisses her on the
lips and we:
FADE TO BLACK.:

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING IN SOHO - DAY

The Young Man loiters outside. He has short hair and wears
dark glasses. Baldy exits with another man. They hail a cab
and leave.
The Young Man wanders down an alley running down the side of
the building. He takes a piece of paper out of his pocket on
which a rough floor plan has been drawn.
He counts windows down the side of the building, stopping at
a particular window to study it. He looks around, puts the
paper back into his pocket and walks back out on to the main
street.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Small, dark, cluttered.
The Young Man enters, carrying a paper bag. He removes his
sunglasses, revealing his bruised face.
He tosses the paper bag on to the bed, then reaches into the
breast pocket of his suit jacket and pulls out a pair of
rubber surgical gloves.
He inflates one before stretching it on to his fingers, then
does the same with the second, interlacing his fingers to jam
the gloves on snugly. He flexes his hands, then turns to the
bed and reaches into the paper bag, removing a brand new
hammer with a rubber grip and a claw head.
41.
He tests the weight of the hammer, first in one hand then in
the other. He awkwardly sticks the hammer into the back of
his waistband and moves to the dusty mirror, examining
himself. He removes the hammer from his waistband and looks
at himself holding it in the mirror, and we:
FADE TO BLACK.:

INT. INSIDE THE HALL OF A LARGE APARTMENT - DAY

Little is visible in the gloom. All is quiet.
Suddenly a splintering crash breaks the silence and the front
door breaks inward, revealing Cobb and the Young Man (long
hair, unshaven), gloves on, glancing about nervously.
Cautiously, they creep into the flat. Cobb shuts the door
behind them. The Young Man moves to the nearest doorway and
opens the door, spilling a cold, diffuse light into the hall.
He opens the next door along and looks in and we
CUT TO::

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Young Man’s POV: expensively and tastefully decorated, almost
cluttered - lots of pictures on the walls, lots of plants.
The Young Man steps back into the hall.

INT. HALL - DAY

The Young Man looks over at Cobb.
YOUNG MAN: (whispering loudly)
Not bad at all.
Cobb turns to look at him.
COBB: (speaking normally)
I’ll check the bedrooms for a bag,
you check out the stuff.
The Young Man nods and passes into the living room.
42.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Young Man enters and crosses to the centre of the large
room. He turns around, scanning the room, taking in
furniture, stereo, plants, TV and VCR, pictures.
Noticing something, he moves closer to a group of pictures on
the wall.
He leans in to study them and his POV reveals a collection of
framed photographs of the same young woman. In some of them
she is obviously posed; the black-and-white ones in
particular look like professionally shot modelling photos.
The Young woman is an attractive blonde.
He stares at the pictures for a few seconds, then turns back
to the room. He crosses to the small table with some framed
photographs on it and leans over to examine the pictures.
They are all of The Blonde. The Young Man picks up one of the
framed photos and looks at it more closely.
COBB (O.S.): Hey! Take a look in here!
The Young Man places the picture back on the table, keeping
his eyes on it until he has moved several steps towards the
door.

INT. HALL - DAY

The Young Man exits the living room and walks down the
corridor looking into the room for Cobb. He enters a room
near the front door.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Double bed, light, feminine, patterned fabrics and many
cushions, a chest of drawers beneath a framed photograph.
Cobb is standing in front of the chest of drawers, the top
drawer open.
He is holding up a garter belt for the Young Man.
COBB: (mischievous,
conspiratorial)
Saucy lady, n’est-ce que pas?
The Young Man approaches, looking at the photograph above the
chest of drawers - it is The Blonde looking serious.
43.
Cobb turns to the chest of drawers and rummages around.
COBB (CONT’D): I haven’t found a bag, yet.
The Young Man comes up beside Cobb and looks into the drawer -
it is full of silk panties. Cobb rummages through them. He
looks move interested in the panties than anything he might
find in them.
YOUNG MAN: This is her flat?
COBB: Yeah, and she’s a fox.
YOUNG MAN: But she’s got pictures of herself
everywhere.
COBB: Yeah, and she looks good. Check
this lot out.
He nods his head at the underwear. The Young Man hesitates
and Cobb jerks his head again. The Young Man reaches into the
drawer and feels through some of the silk undergarments. Cobb
grabs a handful, puts them to his nose and inhales deeply,
looking at the Young Man, who shakes his head and smiles
pityingly. They stand there, two piggies at the trough. The
Young Man grabs some of the panties and lifts them up. He
glances up and freezes, seeing the picture of The Blonde
looking down at the them.
COBB (CONT’D): You should take some.
YOUNG MAN: What?! No way.
COBB: (shrugs)
Suit yourself. I’m going to, she’s
a babe.
He stuffs a handful of silk into his pocket and moves from
the chest of drawers. The Young Man glances at Cobb, then
swiftly pockets some panties when Cobb has turned his back.
The Young Man stares up at the picture of The Blonde as he
backs away.
COBB (O.S.) (CONT’D): Bingo.
44.
The Young Man turns to see Cobb displaying a large leather
holdall. Cobb turns and points at a pair of pearl earrings on
the dresser. He picks just one of them up and heads into the
hall.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Young Man is stuffing CDs into the leather holdall.
Cobb is slumped in a large armchair, watching.
The Young Man straightens up.
COBB: You should take that CD player.
It’s small enough.
The Young Man grabs the player, pulls wires out of the back
and sticks it into the holdall. He moves over to a small
desk. On the desk lies a set of passport photographs. He
stares at four near-identical images of The Blonde.
YOUNG MAN: (without turning around)
Why does she have so many pictures
of herself?
Cobb looks around the room.
COBB: I think she’s a model. Certainly
vain.
The Young Man slips the passport photos off the desk and into
his pocket. Cobb notices but doesn’t say anything - just
smiles to himself. The Young Man turns around. He avoids
making eye contact with Cobb.
YOUNG MAN: That about it?
Cobb looks lazily over the room.
COBB: I think that covers the useful
stuff.
He hauls himself out of his comfortable chair with a groan.
COBB (CONT’D): Let’s go.
He holds up the single pearl earring.
45.
COBB (CONT’D): (mischievous)
I’ll just misplace this for her.
He pulls the seat cushion off the armchair, places the
earring on the chair, dead centre, and replaces the cushion.

EXT. ROW OF TERRACED TOWNHOUSES - DAY

Cobb and the Young Man exit one of the front doors, the Young
Man carrying a full leather holdall.
They turn down the road and walks briskly away.

INT. CHARING CROSS STATION LEFT-LUGGAGE OFFICE - DAY

The Young Man hands over the leather holdall, takes a ticket
and offers it to Cobb.
COBB: (refusing the ticket)
It was your job. You hang on to the
stuff.
They walk out of the station.

EXT. CHARING CROSS STATION - DAY

Cobb and the Young Man talk as they stroll away from the
building.
COBB: Pick it up tomorrow and hang on to
it till I let you know we’re ready
to fence it.
YOUNG MAN: Right.
Cobb looks thoughtfully at the Young Man.
COBB: (seductive, drawing him in
further)
Unless, of course, you want to sell
it yourself and just give me my
half of what you get for it.
YOUNG MAN: Wouldn’t know how to go about it.
46.
COBB: Look, about being hard on you back
at that first place: I won’t let
anyone put me at risk, it’s
dangerous enough already.
They stop, unsure how to proceed.
COBB (CONT’D): An early supper, I think.
YOUNG MAN: Look, I really can’t afford -
COBB: (smiling)
It’s covered.
FADE TO BLACK.:

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Formal, expensive, white linen, mirrors.
The Young Man and The Blonde are seated at a table in one
corner; cosy, intimate. They are having coffee.
THE BLONDE: How was your food?
YOUNG MAN: (looking down)
Fine.
THE BLONDE: So what is it?
YOUNG MAN: You chose this restaurant because
you knew we wouldn’t run into him
here.
THE BLONDE: So?
YOUNG MAN: You said it was over between the
two of you.
THE BLONDE: It is.
47.
YOUNG MAN: Then why -
THE BLONDE: I also said that he’s dangerous.
The Young Man looks at her imploringly.
THE BLONDE (CONT’D): (pitying but impatient)
Fine. An example. One night he came
back to the flat - my flat - with a
couple of the thugs who work for
him. That meant trouble; right away
I could tell something was going to
happen. Then, a little later this
other man arrives...
DISSOLVE TO::

INT. THE BLONDE’S FLAT, FRONT HALL - DAY

A heavy-set man opens the door to a smaller man and motions
him towards the living room.
THE BLONDE (V.O.): ... you don’t need to know who he
was or anything about him except
that he had cheated them out of
some of their money...

INT. THE BLONDE’S FLAT, LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Blonde sits in the armchair, smoking, nervous. Baldy and
a heavy-set man welcome the smaller man into the room.
THE BLONDE (V.O.): ... just money, that’s all.
The two heavy-set men grab the smaller man and force him to
the ground spreading his arms out before him, pinning his
wrists to the floor, one of them kneeling on his back.
Baldy brings the hammer down on to a finger with tremendous
force.
The Blonde gets up to leave. Baldy looks up at her, pointing
at her with the hammer.
BALDY: Stay. Watch.
48.
The Blonde stops at the door and turns around. Baldy starts
smashing all of the smaller man’s fingers in turn.
The Blonde closes her eyes and presses her face against the
door frame as if she’s trying to burrow her way out.
CUT TO::

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The Young Man listens intently.
THE BLONDE: He smashed all of his fingers...
then he split his head open...
CUT TO::

INT. THE BLONDE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Baldy grunts as he brings the hammer down sharply.
Baldy stands up and drops the hammer. There is blood.
The Blonde is crying.
BALDY: Give me a fucking tea-towel or
something.
CUT TO::

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The Young Man is speechless. The Blonde sips at her coffee
before continuing.
THE BLONDE: Dangerous enough for you?
YOUNG MAN: Is it true?
THE BLONDE: Yes.
YOUNG MAN: Christ. You don’t see him any more?
49.
THE BLONDE: (deadpan)
After he messed up my rug like
that?
YOUNG MAN: That’s not funny.
THE BLONDE: I know.
They both sip their coffees. The Young Man looks thoughtfully
at her.
YOUNG MAN: So how did you meet him?
THE BLONDE: Let’s not talk about him -
YOUNG MAN: (bitter)
Did you work for him?
THE BLONDE: (furious)
That’s none of your fucking
business! You’re sick. And a
hypocrite. You loved hearing that
story, you want to hear some more
for your jollies... you’re as bad
as the freak who stole my pants...
(rising from the table)
...well, you can fuck off, you
filthy little shit.
She throws her napkin down, upsetting her water glass, and
strides away from the table. The Young Man grabs the glass,
mopping at the spilt water with the napkin. He looks around
to see if the other diners have noticed (they have). He
catches the waiter’s eye and scribbles in the air for the
bill.
He takes out a credit card. He looks down at it, turning it
over in his hands before laying it down on the table.
The name on the card is Timothy Kerr.
FADE TO BLACK.: 50.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

The Young Man (short hair, sunglasses) glances around before
diving into the side alleyway.
He moves along the building, counting the windows as he goes.
Finding the right one, he pulls his hammer out and levers it
open using the claw. Looking about, he lifts the window and
hauls himself through.

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

Big desk, filing cabinets, couple of chairs.
The Young Man slithers through the window and on to the floor
behind the desk.
He gets on to his haunches and removes his sunglasses,
putting them into his breast pocket. He looks around the
office. It is well lit from the streetlights outside the
windows.
The Young Man moves to the bookshelves and starts to remove
books, stacking them on the floor quickly but quietly.
Halfway through the second shelf he uncovers a safe set into
the wall.
Excited, hands trembling, he removes a piece of paper from
his pocket. It has a series of numbers written on it. He
spins the dial according to the numbers. He tries the door -
it won’t open. He tries the combination again, pulls the door
and this time it swings open to reveal a large stack of
money. The Young Man is shocked by the amount. Next to the
money is an A4 envelope.
YOUNG MAN: Bingo.
He pulls the money and the envelope out of the safe, leaving
it in a pile on the floor. He stands up and looks around.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): (under his breath)
Bag.
He opens the desk drawers, looking in each one. He opens the
closet, searching around, finding nothing.
Increasingly frantic now, the Young Man paces around the
room, peering into every corner, looking behind every piece
of furniture. At length, he stops, exasperated.
51.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): (loud whisper)
FUCK!: He looks at the bundles of banknotes. He looks at the
cluttered desk. There is a roll of masking tape on the desk.
The Young Man steps over, grabs the tape and pulls off a long
strip, breaking it with his teeth and we:
FADE TO BLACK.:

INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - DUSK

Understated. Expensive; polished wooden floors, starched
linen, well-dressed clientele. The Young Man and Cobb are
seated at a table near the back of the place.
Cobb eat his good with small, graceful movements. In his dark
suit and tie he fits right in, unlike the Young Man, who is
shabbily dressed, unshaven, has long greasy hair and looks
ill at ease.
Cobb finishes chewing a large bit of his steak, sips from his
glass of water, then dabs his lips gently with his napkin.
COBB: You’re developing a taste for it.
The Young Man looks up from his food.
COBB (CONT’D): The violating, the voyeurism - it’s
definitely you.
YOUNG MAN: I think not.
COBB: I think so. And I think before long
you’ll develop a taste for the
things you can do with the
proceeds.
YOUNG MAN: Such as?
COBB: (gesturing around them)
This.
YOUNG MAN: You make all of your money that
way.
52.
COBB: (smiling)
Not all of it. You’re going to pay
for this.
YOUNG MAN: But I told you, I can’t afford -
He is silenced by Cobb throwing a credit card on the table.
COBB: It won’t really be you, it’ll be...
(he tilts his head to at
the card)
Timothy Kerr. But I thought I’d
give you the pleasure of pretending
to pay.
YOUNG MAN: But how -
Cobb tosses a pen on to the table next to the card.
COBB: Sign it.
YOUNG MAN: (picking up the card)
Sign it?
He looks at the card. He turns it over; there is no signature
on the white strip. He looks up at Cobb.
COBB: Sign it in your own handwriting and
you can use it for anything. I
wouldn’t use it for more than a day
or two, just to be safe.
YOUNG MAN: (a whisper)
Christ.
The two men smile at each other. The Young Man reaches for
the pen. He signs the back and pockets the card, shaking hsi
head and laughing.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): Don’t you worry about being caught?
COBB: Why else would I do it? Besides,
I’m not going to get caught.
53.
YOUNG MAN: You’ve thought it all through.
COBB: (raises wine glass)
I’ve thought it all through.
(pause)
This is just the tip of the
iceberg, I do things you wouldn’t
believe.
YOUNG MAN: Such as?
COBB: An example. Sometimes when I’m
watching a place I’ll see that the
owners are about to go on holiday.
I’ll wait till they’ve gone, then
move in for a week or so.
YOUNG MAN: You’ve got to be joking.
COBB: Happens a lot more often than you’d
think.
YOUNG MAN: But how do you know how long
they’ll be gone for?
COBB: Almost always marked on the kitchen
calendar.
YOUNG MAN: (a whisper)
Christ.
He takes a sip from his win, then shovels a forkful of food
into his mouth. He chews for a second then freezes, his eyes
locked on something at the far end of the restaurant, behind
Cobb.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): (through steak)
Jesus fucking Christ!
Cobb narrows his eyes.
COBB: What’s wrong?
54.
YOUNG MAN: (swallows hard)
The woman, the woman from that
first place, the  one who came
home, the, the, the one who saw me -
us... she just walked in.
The Young Man’s POV shows us the young woman from the first
robbery and a man, whom we have not seen before, waiting to
be seated.
COBB: (calm, not turning round)
Are you sure?
YOUNG MAN: Yes, I’m fucking sure!
COBB: (impatient)
Is she with the same bloke?
YOUNG MAN: No.
COBB: We’re all right then.
YOUNG MAN: All right?! What if she sees us?!
COBB: If she sees us, she won’t do
anything. She’s with her partner
now and she won’t want to have to
explain how she found us at their
flat when she was supposed to be at
work.
YOUNG MAN: That’s one hell of a chance to
take!
COBB: (fed up)
Look, just calm down. What would
she do anyway? All we stole was
half a bottle of an indifferent red
wine. Just relax, keep your head.
The Young Man looks at his plate, trying to stay calm.
YOUNG MAN: You mind if we skip dessert?
55.
COBB: (with disgust)
Yes, I fucking mind.

INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Later.
Cobb is scraping up the last of his chocolate mousse. An
almost untouched dessert sits in front of the Young Man, who
repeatedly glances up past Cobb’s head. The Young Man’s POV
shows us the young woman seated with her companion at the
other end of the restaurant.
The young woman pushes her chair back from the table, stands
up, places her napkin on her chair and heads towards Cobb and
the Young Man’s table. The Young Man looks terrified.
YOUNG MAN: She’s coming this way.
Cobb looks up from his chocolate mousse. He nods at a door
off to his left.
COBB: She’s going to the loo, relax.
The Young Man can’t take his eye off the young woman as she
approaches.
She comes near their table. As she turns to the left she
notices the Young Man and looks at him for an instant with
something which might be recognition. She carries on, passing
through the doors to the lavatories.
YOUNG MAN: (losing it)
She fucking looked at me!
COBB: Yeah?
YOUNG MAN: Yeah! She fucking knows - we have
to leave!
Cobb places his spoon back into his dish and looks up at the
Young Man with an almost bored expression.
56.
COBB: (gesturing to the waiter)
We’ll leave - not that we have
anything to worry about other than
you making a twat of yourself.

EXT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Cobb and the Young Man exit. Cobb suddenly turns on the Young
Man as if he might hit him.
COBB: (pointing at the Young
Man’s face)
You know, I really hate it when I
don’t get to finish a good meal
with a coffee.
The Young Man looks flabbergasted.
YOUNG MAN: But -
COBB: (bitter)
Just don’t fucking say it!
He waves at a taxi.

INT. BACK OF TAXI - NIGHT

Cobb looks out of the window like a sullen child. The Young
Man looks at him, thinking.
YOUNG MAN: Look, she recognized me, OK? She’s
had a second look at me. It makes
me nervous.
Cobb turns to the Young Man.
COBB: (calm)
If you’re worried about being
recognized, why don’t you do
something about your appearance?
Haircut, smart clothes, your own
mother won’t recognize you.
The Young Man looks down at himself, chastened.
57.
COBB (CONT’D): (grinning to himself)
Just because you break into
people’s homes, doesn’t mean you
have to look like a criminal.
FADE TO BLACK.:

EXT. ROW OF TERRACED TOWNHOUSES - NIGHT

The Young Man (short hair, clean-shaven) buzzes The Blonde.
THE BLONDE: (voice on tannoy)
Fuck off.
YOUNG MAN: How do you know it’s me? Could be
your mother you just told to fuck
off.
THE BLONDE: (voice on tannoy)
I mean it.
YOUNG MAN: Please, just let me in... I’ve come
to apologize.
The lock clicks open and he steps inside.

INT. THE BLONDE’S FLAT, HALLWAY - NIGHT

The Young Man walks slowly down the corridor. Passing the
bedroom he sees The Blonde Sitting on the bed. He stands in
the doorway.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Double bed, light, feminine, patterned fabrics and many
cushions, a chest of drawers.
The Blonde sits on the bed, legs crossed, smoking a
cigarette. The Young Man considers his opening line.
THE BLONDE: So apologize.
YOUNG MAN: I haven’t been entirely honest with
you.
58.
The Blonde raises her eyebrows.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): I’m writing about burglaries.
THE BLONDE: (confused)
What?
YOUNG MAN: I’m researching burglaries. I’m,
I’m doing a piece about a guy I
know who burgles people. That’s why
I’ve been asking you questions
about your burglary.
THE BLONDE: Why didn’t you just tell me.
YOUNG MAN: I didn’t want to upset you. See,
I’ve been breaking into houses with
him - that is, he’s been breaking
in and I’ve been watching him. I
mean, I haven’t taken anything
or... whatever, I just go along and
watch, for my research.
THE BLONDE: Is that it?
YOUNG MAN: Yes.
THE BLONDE: What does that have to do with
anything?
YOUNG MAN: Now I’ve been honest with you, I’d
like you to return the favor.
THE BLONDE: I have been honest with you.
YOUNG MAN: You’re still seeing the bald guy.
THE BLONDE: (flustered)
How do -
59.
YOUNG MAN: I was early the other day. I saw
him leave. You said it was over.
THE BLONDE: (resigned)
It is.
YOUNG MAN: (quizzical)
Then why?
THE BLONDE: He’s blackmailing me.
YOUNG MAN: You said he’s rich - why would...
THE BLONDE: (bitter)
Who said anything about money?
The Young Man sighs. He slides down the wall to sit in the
doorway, his back against the frame. After a moment’s thought
he looks up at The Blonde.
YOUNG MAN: What’s he blackmailing you with?
THE BLONDE: Photos.
YOUNG MAN: Of what?
THE BLONDE: Of me. And don’t ask me anything
else about them. You’d only want
the details to fuel your seedy
little fantasies. Let’s just say
that my mother wouldn’t frame them
for her sideboard.
YOUNG MAN: You’ve got me all wrong, you know.
THE BLONDE: Have I?
The Young Man nods. He thinks for a moment.
YOUNG MAN: So where does he keep them?
60.
THE BLONDE: In his office. Why?
YOUNG MAN: Maybe I can get them back.
THE BLONDE: How?
YOUNG MAN: Break in and take them. I can get
my friend to do it with me - there
must be valuable stuff in his
office, right?
THE BLONDE: He sometimes has money in his safe.
YOUNG MAN: (shaking his head)
No, we can’t get into a safe -
THE BLONDE: That’s where the pictures are.
YOUNG MAN: What?
THE BLONDE: In a manilla envelope in his safe,
negatives and eight-by-ten prints.
YOUNG MAN: Then we can’t -
THE BLONDE: I know the combination.
YOUNG MAN: How?
THE BLONDE: I’ve seen him open it a million
times. I’ve always figured that I
might get a chance to lift the
photos.
YOUNG MAN: Right, that’s what we’ll do then.
He gets up and moves on to the bed.
61.
THE BLONDE: Nobody in their right mind would
steal from him.
YOUNG MAN: (putting his arms around
her)
If we don’t get caught it won’t
make any difference who it was we
stole from - and we won’t get
caught.
He kisses The Blonde. She pulls away to speak.
THE BLONDE: Just promise me one thing. If you
get the pictures you’ll bring them
to me without looking at them,
without even opening the envelope.
YOUNG MAN: Of course.
THE BLONDE: I’ve got your word?
YOUNG MAN: You have my word.
They kiss again.
FADE TO BLACK.:

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

The Young Man (short hair, bruised face) has taken his jacket
off and is frantically taping bundles of money to his arms
and around his waist. He works in a frenzy, ripping masking
tape with his teeth, grabbing bundles and slapping them
against his stomach. He covers his arms and abdomen, but
there’s still a lot more money, so he undoes his trousers,
pulls them off and frantically starts to tape bundles to his
bare legs. His jacket, the manilla envelope and his hammer
are sitting on the desk. He grabs a bundle and tapes it to
his ankle. He straightens up, looks at the remaining money.
YOUNG MAN: (whisper)
Fuck it.
He takes the tape and passes it around his midriff, securing
the bundles which he has already taped to his waist.
62.
As he is doing so the overhead light snaps on and the Young
Man freezes.
One of Baldy’s business companions is standing in the office
doorway, a look of amazement on his face. Neither man moves.
The Young Man eyes the hammer on the desk, within easy reach.
He grabs it as he launches himself at Baldy’s man, trailing
bank notes in the air behind him as he flies across the room,
hammer raised.
The Young Man brings the hammer down across the other man’s
head in a nasty sideswipe. The man goes down and doesn’t get
up. The Young Man moves back to the desk, shocked. He
clumsily puts his trousers on over the money, then looks over
at the man on the floor as he grabs for his suit jacket. The
man is not moving; there is blood on his head and on the
floor.
The Young Man gets his jacket on, tears his eyes away from
the prone man to realize that he has blood on his hands and
now on his previously white shirt. He shudders as he jams the
bloody hammer into his waistband, grabs the manilla envelope
and heads for the window. A last glance at the prone man
before climbing out of the window.

EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

The Young Man practically falls out of the window and on to
the ground. He struggles to his feet, weaving like a drunk,
and heads away from the office window towards the main
street.
FADE TO BLACK.:

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Small, cold, dingy.
The Young Man stands in front of the mirror, examining his
longish hair and attempt at a beard.
He picks up some nail scissors and starts to cut his hair.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Small, dark, cluttered.
The Young Man is knotting a tie in front of a dusty, cracked
mirror. He is wearing a dark suit, old-fashioned and well-
worn. His hair is dramatically shorter; a ragged near-crew
cut.
63.
He plays with his hair, looking at his reflection. He rubs
his newly shaven chin.
Close on the mirror we see that the strip of passport photos
of The Blonde are wedged into the bottom right-hand corner of
the frame.
The Young Man’s eye is caught by the photos and he picks them
up, looking closely at them, a thoughtful expression on his
face.
CUT TO::

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Lighter. Neater, apart from the paper-covered desk.
The Young Man is on the phone, waiting for it to be picked up
at the other end. We hear the click as it is answered.
MALE VOICE (O.S.): Yeah?
YOUNG MAN: Cobb? Bill.
MALE VOICE (O.S.): Hello, ‘Bill’.

YOUNG MAN (O.S.): Nothing too important.
CUT TO::

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

YOUNG MAN: It’s about the stuff.
64.
COBB (O.S.): What about it?
The Young Man’s other hand comes into frame; he is holding
the passport photos as well as some bunched-up silk.
YOUNG MAN: (staring at the photos)
I’ve met a guy - I won’t go into
details. I’ll take care of it
myself as you suggested, and you’ll
get half. I can’t promise to get as
much as you would but I’d like to
give it a go. How does that sound?
COBB (O.S.): Sounds fine. Anything else?
YOUNG MAN: I took your advice.
COBB (O.S.): What advice?
YOUNG MAN: My appearance. I cut my hair, and
I’m all dressed up.
COBB (O.S.): ‘With no place to go.’
CUT TO::

INT. BY THE WINDOW - DAY

COBB: You know I wasn’t being entirely
serious about that.
YOUNG MAN (O.S.): It makes me feel better.
COBB: Safer, huh?
YOUNG MAN (O.S.): Safer. I’ll give you a call when
I’ve got the money.
COBB: Right.
65.
He hangs up. We go wider and see that he is leaning on the
windowsill in what appears to be a bedroom. His shirt is
completely untucked and unbuttoned.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.): What was all that about?
COBB: You.
Cobb’s POV shows us The Blonde, lying in bed, under the
sheets, but apparently naked.
COBB (CONT’D): Your stuff, anyway.
He clambers up on to the bed to lean against the wall beside
The Blonde.
COBB (CONT’D): He’s going to deal with it himself.
The Blonde lays her arm across Cobb’s stomach and looks up at
him.
THE BLONDE: Meaning?
COBB: Meaning he took the bait and he’s
hooked. He’s going to hang on to
your stuff, pretend to sell it,
give me some money. If you’re lucky
he might even give you most of it
back. It’s perfect, the photos
worked. I’ve even got him to cut
his hair and change his clothes.
THE BLONDE: So are you going to tell me where
you hid my earring, now?
COBB: (grinning)
No. And I wouldn’t hold your breath
for the return of your underwear,
either. He’ll be far too
embarrassed to admit to stealing
your panties.
THE BLONDE: Shit. And did you have to pretend
to break down my door?
66.
(MORE): Couldn’t you have pretended to find
the spare key?
COBB: (laughing)
Couldn’t. That would have been
three spare keys in a row - even
‘Bill’ isn’t going to buy that.
When went to his place it was
embarrassing - right under the mat,
just like I told him... pathetic.
It was a new mat as well, and I
swear, I seriously think he went
out and bought the mat just so he
could put his key under it.
The Blonde laughs. Cobb laughs.
FADE TO::

INT. YOUNG MAN’S BEDROOM - DAY

The Young Man is knotting his tie in front of the mirror.
The Blonde is lying on the bed behind him.
THE BLONDE: What if he won’t help?
YOUNG MAN: Then I’ll do it on my own.
THE BLONDE: How long will you be?
YOUNG MAN: Couple of hours.

EXT. CHARING CROSS STATION LEFT-LUGGAGE OFFICE - DAY

The Young Man hands over his ticket and collects the leather
holdall.

EXT. HUNGERFORD BRIDGE - DAY

The Young Man crosses south, carrying the leather holdall.

INT. HALLWAY IN A BLOCK OF FLATS - DAY

The Young Man knocks on a door.
67.
THE BLONDE (CONT'D): The door is opened by Cobb.
COBB: You’re late.
(noticing the holdall)
You said you’d fenced it.
He steps back to let the Young Man in.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Comfortable, tastefully furnished.
Cobb is sitting on the couch. The Young Man stands at the
window.
COBB: It’ll take me a few days to sell
all of it.
YOUNG MAN: Whatever.
COBB: Something else on your mind?
The Young Man turns to face Cobb.
YOUNG MAN: I want to break into a place.
COBB: I’ve been scouting a couple -
YOUNG MAN: A particular place. For some
photos.
COBB: Photos?
YOUNG MAN: Photos. For a friend.
COBB: What’s the place?
YOUNG MAN: Office. In a safe, but we’ll have
the combination.
68.
COBB: If it’s for a friend, where’s the
money in it?
YOUNG MAN: There’s money in the safe...
probably.
COBB: Probably? Whose office?
YOUNG MAN: Club-owner, pornographer type.
COBB: Heavy?
YOUNG MAN: From the sound of it.
Cobb exhales. He stares hard at the Young Man.
COBB: What the fuck’s going on?
YOUNG MAN: I’m seeing someone. They need my
help.
Cobb stands up and walks over to the Young Man.
COBB: Who are you seeing?
The Young Man looks away.
COBB (CONT’D): (loud)
Who?! Who are you seeing?!
The Young Man looks into Cobb’s eyes.
YOUNG MAN: The owner of the bag.
COBB: (confused)
What?
YOUNG MAN: The woman who owns the flat we hit -
the one with the pictures of
herself.
69.
COBB: (barely concealing rage)
Tell me you’re fucking joking.
YOUNG MAN: (excited)
Her pictures - I was curious, I
followed her, got to know her.
She’... she’s... she’s... we’re in
love.
COBB: You’ve slept with her?
YOUNG MAN: (unaware of Cobb’s growing
rage)
Yeah. She’s fantastic, amazing.
That’s why I haven’t sold her
stuff, I mean, I thought that I
might give it back to her but that
would mean -
COBB: That would mean telling her that it
was you who fucking robbed her! How
shrew - How, how, how, prudent of
you not to tell her that!
The Young Man is quiet, realizing he has misjudged the
situation.
COBB (CONT’D): Nice hair, by the way. And a nice
suit, shame about the bloodstains,
though.
YOUNG MAN: (looks down at himself)
Bloodstains?
Cobb punches him in the face then belts him in the stomach.
The Young Man doubles over, groaning.
COBB: I fucking warned you.
He smiles as he brings his elbows down hard into the Young
Man’s back. The Young Man grunts and staggers to the side,
just keeping on his feet. Cobb pushes him back across the
room and charges at him.
COBB (CONT’D): I won’t let anyone put me at risk.
70.
As he speaks, Cobb grabs the Young Man’s face with one hand
and punches him hard in the face several times.
The Young Man slips to the floor, dragging Cobb down with
him. The two men scrabble around on the floor, the Young Man
putting up a right until Cobb finally swivels round and boots
him in the ribs, then the face.
The Young Man groans and bleeds as Cobb staggers to his feet,
out of breath. Cobb dusts himself down and does his hair in
the mirror.
COBB (CONT’D): (at his reflection)
Idiot. How could you be so stupid?
(turns to look at the
Young Man)
You’re on your own, Billy-boy.
Here...
(reaches into his pocket
and pulls out a pair of
rubber gloves; he tosses
them at the Young Man)
... take these. Present from you.
To get you started on your new solo
career.
He reaches down and pulls the Young Man to his feet. The
Young Man’s face is a bloody mess. Cobb picks up the rubber
gloves and stuffs them into the Young Man’s breast pocket.
He drags the Young Man to the door.
COBB (CONT’D): Now, fuck off.
He throws the Young Man out of the door and slams it behind
him. He laughs hysterically as he walks back into the living
room and we:
DISSOLVE TO::

INT. COBB’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Cobb is lying on the floor, tossing a golfball into the air
and catching it just before it hits his face.
The Blonde is sitting on the couch.
THE BLONDE: Did you have to beat him?
71.
COBB: Did you have to sleep with him?
THE BLONDE: You told me to.
COBB: I said you should if you had to,
that’s not the same as telling you
to.
(catches the ball and
looks over)
Did you enjoy it?
THE BLONDE: Did you enjoy beating him up?
COBB: Of course.
The Blonde shakes her head pityingly.
COBB (CONT’D): He brought it on himself. He didn’t
have to tell me he was seeing you,
but once he did I had to react the
way I would really.
He sits up.
COBB (CONT’D): I’m in deep shit, this has to work.
THE BLONDE: But why are you so sure they think
you were involved?
COBB: They’ve already had me in for
questioning, for Christ’s sake.
They know my m.o. And it’s just a
matter of time before they find the
bloke who saw me leave and pull me
in.
THE BLONDE: You think he got a good look at
you?
72.
COBB: No, which is why this will work;
all we need is someone else with
the same way of working and roughly
the same appearance caught in the
act.
THE BLONDE: Why can’t you just tell them what
really happened - that you just
found her like that?
COBB: If you’d seen her, you wouldn’t
even ask. It was horrible, blood
everywhere. Her face had been...
beaten... almost not human. I’d
been in the flat a while, I may
have left traces, forensic stuff, I
don’t know. But she was fresh, she
hadn’t been dead long, the witness
might put me there close enough to
the time of death -
THE BLONDE: But if he didn’t get the a good
look -
COBB: That’s not the point! A crime that
brutal, an old lady beaten like
that... if they think it’s me,
they’ll find a way to make it
stick. There has to be someone else
- I’ve told them there’s someone
else!
THE BLONDE: What if he has an alibi?
COBB: He’s a loner, that’s why he’s so
perfect. And he looks so different
now that strangers aren’t going to
remember having seen him. He’s our
man.
The Blonde and Cobb look at each other.
FADE TO BLACK.: 73.

EXT. NARROW PASSAGEWAY CONNECTING TWO STREETS LIT BY A

STREETLIGHT - NIGHT: It is raining.
The Young Man (short shair, shades) stumbles along. His dark
suit bulges oddly. He brings his hand up to adjust his shades
and we see a fifty-pound note sticking out of his cuff.
He disappears around the corner and we:
CUT TO::

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The Young Man has taken his suit off and is removing the
money from his body. He is wet, his tie is loose, there is
blood on his shirt, he is on the phone.
YOUNG MAN: (strained, on edge)
I got it.
THE BLONDE (O.S.): You’re bringing them to me?
YOUNG MAN: (bending to remove money
from his leg)
I had to stop off to dump the
money.
THE BLONDE (O.S.): Money?
YOUNG MAN: (giggling)
Lot of fucking money!
He yelps as he yanks tape from his hairy legs.
THE BLONDE (O.S.): What?
YOUNG MAN: Nothing. I’ll be over soon.
THE BLONDE (O.S.): So it was OK?
YOUNG MAN: (a pause, close to tears)
OK, yeah. I’ll be over soon.
74.
He hangs up the phone. He’s removed most of the money, but
odd bundles hang from his legs and shirt.
He looks at the hammer lying on the floor, blood on it. Next
to the hammer lies the manilla envelope.
The Young Man picks up the envelope, pauses for a moment,
then rips it open and yanks out the contents: eight-by-ten
glossies.
The photos are straight modelling portrait shots of The
Blonde - absolutely nothing interesting or remarkable about
them whatsoever.
He flips through them again and again looking for some
meaning, some super-subtle obscenity he might be missing, a
manic desperate look developing on his face.
He flings them across the room, and we:
CUT TO::

EXT. OUTSIDE THE BLONDE’S FLAT

The Young Man looks up at the window. He’s not happy.

INT. THE BLONDE’S FRONT HALL - NIGHT

The Blonde moves to answer the door.
The door opens to reveal a wet, bedraggled Young Man, bruises
on his face. The Young Man slaps The Blonde hard and walks in
past her. She expresses neither pain nor surprise.
THE BLONDE: You promised me you wouldn’t look
in the envelope.
YOUNG MAN: Wasn’t sealed, they fell out.
The Blonde stairs at him with a half-smile.
THE BLONDE: Right... They fell out.
The Young Man looks back at her coldly.
YOUNG MAN: Are you going to explain?
The Blonde says nothing.
75.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): (rising anger)
What?! Was it all bullshit just to
get the money?
THE BLONDE: (shrugs)
He’s never had any in there before.
The Young Man grabs her by the shoulders and shakes her.
YOUNG MAN: What, then?!!
The Blonde puts her hands up defensively to tell him to
remove his hands. He does so.
THE BLONDE: (matter-of-factly)
For a friend. The police think he
did something which he didn’t and
he needs a decoy - another likely
suspect, someone caught robbing a
place the same way he does, using
his methods.
YOUNG MAN: His methods?
(truth dawning)
Who’s the friend?
THE BLONDE: (mischievous, waiting for
a reaction)
Cobb.
The Young Man closes his eyes.
The Blonde turns away.
THE BLONDE (CONT’D): (straight)
He broke into a flat a couple of
weeks ago. Found an old lady who’d
been beaten to death. He ran off,
somebody saw him and a few days
later the police picked him up for
questioning. They think he killed
her -
YOUNG MAN: (opens eyes)
He probably did.
76.
THE BLONDE: He’s a thief, Not a murderer. He
told them they had the wrong man,
had him confused with another
burglar he knew about, one who has
the same m.o....you.
YOUNG MAN: Why me?
THE BLONDE: (like it’s his own fault)
You set yourself up for it. Cobb
noticed you following him days
before he approached you - at first
the thought you were the police but
then he followed you -
YOUNG MAN: He followed me?
THE BLONDE: (sarcastic)
He followed you and realized that
you were just some... weirdo...
waiting to be drawn into it, used.
YOUNG MAN: (asking for it)
So you and Cobb...
The Blonde shrugs and smiles.
The Young Man slaps the wall hard by the side of The Blonde’s
head. She doesn’t flinch. He turns around, raising his hands
in total frustration.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): How could you do this to me? To
anyone?
THE BLONDE: It’s not that bad. You’ve got the
money. You didn’t kill the old
woman. You’re just there to plant
doubt in the minds of the police -
they’ll never charge you. The idea
was that someone would catch you
breaking in tonight, the police
would pull you in, then ask you
about the old lady - which you
wouldn’t know anything about.
77.
YOUNG MAN: (incredulous)
Yeah, but they’d still charge me
with breaking and entering!
THE BLONDE: (amused)
But you did do that. And anyway,
for whatever reason, nobody did
catch you red-handed.
YOUNG MAN: (wielding the bloody
hammer)
He came in, he went down. I didn’t
hang around to see if he got up.
It’s his blood on my hammer.
(smashes hammer into wall)
How could you do this to me?
THE BLONDE: (unimpressed)
It’s not personal. When I agreed to
it, I didn’t even known you.
The Young Man drops the hammer. The Blonde opens her eyes.
The Young Man takes a deep breath, regains his composure.
YOUNG MAN: I’m going to the police in the
morning.
THE BLONDE: You can’t.
YOUNG MAN: I’m going and I’ll tell them
everything.
THE BLONDE: You can’t - they’ll never believe
you.
YOUNG MAN: I’ll tell them everything and
they’ll believe me because it’s the
truth.
THE BLONDE: They’ll never believe you unless
someone backs you up.
YOUNG MAN: You could.
78.
THE BLONDE: I won’t.
YOUNG MAN: (confident)
They’ll make you. Your lies won’t
hold up against the truth.
The Blonde turns away, shaking her head.
THE BLONDE: You know, I really wouldn’t do -
She is cut off by the sound of the door slamming. She turns
to see that the Young Man is gone.
FADE TO BLACK.:

INT. ROOM WITH TABLE - DAY

Close on the Young Man (short hair, bruises)
YOUNG MAN: That’s it.
Wider shows us a room lit by early morning sun, the Young Man
seated at a table, an Older Man opposite. Between them on the
table is a tape recorder. They both look tired. The Older Man
doesn’t speak.
YOUNG MAN (CONT’D): I mean.. If you’ve got questions..
The Older Man leans forward.
OLDER MAN: One or two.
A pause. The Young Man raises his eyebrows in expectation.

any unsolved murders of old ladies
right now.
YOUNG MAN: (baffled)
But there has -
OLDER MAN: (more assertive)
There is no such ongoing
investigation.
The Young Man looks confused and scared.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D): And we don’t know this...

INT. THE BLONDE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Blonde and Cobb are having a drink.
COBB: I warned you he’d look in the
envelope.
THE BLONDE: He gave me his word. I believed
him.
COBB: Nothing personal, he couldn’t help
himself - he’s a born peeper.
Anyway, down to business.
THE BLONDE: Business?
80.
Cobb takes a handkerchief out of his pocket and starts to
wipe the outside of his glass and we:
CUT TO::

INT. ROOM WITH TABLE - DAY

We move in on the Young Man, puzzled, thinking hard.
OLDER MAN (O.S.): Perhaps there’s something else
you’d like to tell me about.
CUT TO::

INT. THE BLONDE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Blonde watches, puzzled as Cobb stretches his rubber
gloves and puts them on, interlacing his fingers for a snug
fit.
COBB: Where’s the hammer?
THE BLONDE: Oh, down there in the bag.
She points to a shopping bag on the table across from Cobb.
Cobb rises, crosses the room and picks up the bag with his
back to The Blonde. She can’t see him take it out of the bag
and look at the dried blood on its head.
THE BLONDE (CONT’D): What are you going to do with it?
COBB: (his back to her)
The old man was pretty specific
about the way I should do things.
THE BLONDE: (puzzled)
What’s he have to say about it?
COBB: (turning around, hammer in
hand)
Well, he is giving me all the money
out of his safe.
81.
THE BLONDE: (not liking this)
Money? What for?
CUT TO::

INT. ROOM WITH TABLE - DAY

Close on the Young Man as he thinks.
The Older Man puts on a pair of rubber surgical gloves.
OLDER MAN (O.S.): Anything at all. Your side of
things?

INT. THE BLONDE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Cobb moves towards The Blonde with the hammer.
COBB: (smiling)
He says your demands have become
unreasonable... too greedy in your
blackmail.
THE BLONDE: (scared now)
But, no - I, I, I don’t -
COBB: (smiling, soothing)
Something about an incident you
witnessed in this very room? He was
specific about where and how I
should take care of things. Some
sense of poetic justice, I suppose.
THE BLONDE: But I -
COBB: Something about a bloodstained
carpet you’ve got stashed away to
back up your story, should it ever
be told.
The Blonde is crying.
82.
THE BLONDE: How could you do this to me?
COBB: (softly)
Money.
He lunges for The Blonde, grabbing her wrist and pulling her
to the floor. He forces her hand flat against the floor and
raises the hammer high above his had and we:
CUT TO::

INT. ROOM WITH TABLE - DAY

Close on the Young Man as he realizes something.
YOUNG MAN: Did you talk to her?
OLDER MAN: (nods gravely)
We found her early this morning.
YOUNG MAN: Found her?
OLDER MAN: Her body.
The Young Man covers his face with his hands.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D): We also found a hammer with two
types of blood on it, one type
which I assume will match the block
you put in the hospital. All of her
fingers were smashed - you must
have tortured her for the
combination.
YOUNG MAN: NO! I haven’t done anything to her!
Go and pick up Cobb, he did it, he
must have done it -
The Older man silences the Young Man by putting a shoebox on
the table between them.
OLDER MAN: (rifling through the
contents of the box)
83.
(MORE): We found some interesting items at
your flat. In addition to the
various items which the deceased
reported stolen last week, we found
several pairs of ladies’ underwear -
are they hers?
The Young Man says nothing.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D): I assume so, since they were found
stashed with some passport-style
photographs of the deceased.
The Young Man closes his eyes.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D): (pulls a small, clear
plastic bag from the box)
We also found this pearl earring.
The Young Man opens his eyes. He looks at the evidence bag
which the Older Man is holding out for him to see. Inside it
is The Blonde’s pearl earring.
OLDER MAN (CONT’D): It matches the one worn by the
deceased at the time of her death.
Little trophy?
YOUNG MAN: (desperation)
NO! Cobb planted it! He took it
when we broke in - pick him up, I
gave you his address, he’s the one
who killed her - he has to be.
OLDER MAN: We went to the address you gave us.
There’s no ‘Cobb’ there. The flat
belongs to a...
(checks notes)
... Timothy Kerr. He just got back
from holiday and he says that he
was robbed while he was away. Not
too much was taken... but his new
credit card hasn’t arrived -
YOUNG MAN: That was Cobb, see?! We used it to
buy a meal one time!
The Older Man reaches into the box and pulls out another
clear evidence bag. Inside it is as credit card.
84.
OLDER MAN (CONT'D):
OLDER MAN: We found this at your flat.
YOUNG MAN: (running out of steam)
It was... Cobb who stole it...
The Older Man flips the card over to display the signature on
the back.
OLDER MAN: Is this your handwriting?
The Young Man looks at the card in despair.
YOUNG MAN: (quiet)
Yes.

COOPER: Sorry. Go back to sleep.
MURPH: I thought you were the ghost.
COOPER: There’s no ghost, Murph.
MURPH: Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
COOPER: Maybe Grandpa’s a little too close
to being one himself. Back to

MURPH: Were you dreaming about the crash?
COOPER: Back to sleep, Murph.
Murph shuffles back out the door. Cooper moves to the

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MORNING

Cooper pours himself coffee as Donald puts grits on the
table. TOM, Cooper’s fifteen-year-old son, stuffs his face.
Murph, wet hair, towel around neck, plays with pieces of a
MODEL (a lunar lander).
DONALD: Not at the table, Murph.
MURPH: Dad, can you fix this?
COOPER: (takes pieces, frowning)
What’d you do to my lander?
MURPH: Wasn’t me.
TOM: Lemme guess - your ghost?
MURPH: It knocked it off my shelf. It
keeps knocking books off.
TOM: There’s no such things as ghosts,
dumb-ass -

COOPER: (to Tom)
Hey -
MURPH: I looked it up, it’s called a
poltergeist.
TOM: Dad, tell her.
COOPER: Murph, you know that’s not
scientific.
MURPH: You say science is about admitting
what we don’t know.
DONALD: She’s got you there.
COOPER: (hands her pieces)
Start looking after our stuff.
Donald looks at Cooper, admonishing. Cooper shrugs.
COOPER: Fine. Murph, you wanna talk
science, don’t just tell me you’re
scared of some ghost - record the
facts, analyze, present your
conclusions.
MURPH: Sure.
Cooper gets up, grabs his keys.
DONALD: Hold up.
(Off look.)
Parent-teacher conferences.
’Parent’ - not ’grandparent’.

COOPER: Dust storm?
DONALD: (shakes his head)
Nelson’s torching his whole crop.
COOPER: Blight?
DONALD: They’re saying it’s the last
harvest for okra. Ever.
Cooper stares at the smoke. Uneasy. Gets into the truck.
COOPER: Shoulda planted corn like the rest
of us.
DONALD: Be nice to Miss Hanley. She’s
single.
COOPER: What’s that supposed to mean?
DONALD: Repopulating the Earth - start

COOPER: Start minding your business.

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DIRT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper sips his coffee, steering while Murph shifts -
COOPER: Okay, gimme second -
Murph wrestles the long gear stick into second. Cooper sips.
COOPER: Now third -
Murph struggles to find third - GRIND.
TOM: Find a gear, dumb-ass.
6.
MURPH: Shut up, Tom!
BANG - A TIRE BLOWS OUT. Cooper stops the truck.
TOM: What’d you do, Murph?
COOPER: She didn’t do anything. We lost a
tire is all.
TOM: Murphy’s Law.
MURPH: Shut up, Tom.
Cooper gets out of the truck, checks the flat, turns to Tom.
COOPER: Grab the spare.
TOM: That is the spare.
COOPER: Okay, patch kit.
TOM: How’m I supposed to patch it out
here?
COOPER: Figure it out. I’m not always going
to be here to help you.
Tom moves to the back of the truck. Murph is there.
MURPH: Why’d you and Mom name me after
something bad?
COOPER: We didn’t.
MURPH: Murphy’s Law?
COOPER: Murphy’s Law doesn’t mean bad stuff
will happen. It means ’whatever can
happen, will happen’. And that
sounded just fine to us.
7.
Murph frowns, hearing something ...
COOPER: What?
Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLE. Cooper GRABS Murph
as a DRONE SOARS low overhead -
COOPER: Come on!
Cooper jumps into the truck - he pulls out a laptop and
antenna hands them to Murph - shouts at Tom -
COOPER: Get in!
TOM: (jack in hand)
What about the tire?

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK THROUGH FIELDS - MOMENTS LATER

Close on the SHREDDING TIRE as the truck BARRELS through
cornfields. Murph fires up the laptop. Cooper strains to see
through the cornstalks, scanning the horizon -
TOM: There!
To the right, the dark shape of the drone, cruising low over
the fields. Cooper JERKS the wheel - the drone has long,
thin wings like a U-2, but no cockpit.
COOPER: Indian air force surveillance
drone. Solar cells could power an
entire farm.
(To Tom.)
Take the wheel -
Tom takes the wheel - Cooper hands Murph the antenna.
COOPER: Keep it pointed right at it -
Cooper works the laptop - the screen fills with Hindi.
Faster, Tom. I’m losing it.
Tom WEAVES through the corn - they round a corner, almost
HIT a HARVESTER - BANG - the truck loses a wing mirror -
Ahead the drone SOARS, banking, pulling away -

The truck BURSTS out of the corn, Cooper’s nose is in the
laptop.
TOM: Dad?
COOPER: Almost got it. Don’t stop.
In front of them, the drone plummets from view into the next
valley - the path ahead leads to a three-hundred-foot drop.
TOM:
DAD ...: Cooper looks up.
COOPER: Tom!
Tom locks up the brakes. Cooper looks at him - he shrugs.
TOM: You told me to keep going.
Cooper grabs the laptop and opens the door.
COOPER: Guess that answers the ’if I told
you to drive off a cliff’ scenario.
Murph is still pointing the antenna.
MURPH: We lost it.
COOPER: (smiles)
No, we didn’t.
The DRONE SOARS BACK OVER THEM - Cooper is moving his
fingers across the track pad, PILOTING THE DRONE.
As the kids watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring over them,
banking above the valley. Cooper crouches next to Murph.
COOPER: Want to give it a whirl?
Murph, guided by Cooper, moves her fingers across the track
pad - the massive drone BANKS in response. Murph is in
heaven.

COOPER: Let’s set her down next to the
river.

The truck limps up to the drone. Cooper and the kids climb
down. Cooper runs a hand along the smooth carbon flank of
the aircraft.
TOM: How long you think it’s been up
there?
COOPER: Delhi mission control went down
same as ours, ten years ago.
TOM: It’s been up there ten years? Why’d
it come down so low?
COOPER: Sun finally cooked its brain. Or it
came down looking for something.
MURPH: What?
COOPER: Some kind of signal. Who knows?
Cooper finds an access hatch. Pries it open. Examines the
black-box brain of the machine.
MURPH: What are you going to do with it?
COOPER: Give it something socially
responsible to do, like drive a
combine.
MURPH: Couldn’t we just let it go? It’s
not hurting anyone.
Cooper looks down at his daughter. Good kid.
COOPER: This thing has to adapt, just like
the rest of us.
10.

EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL - DAY

The truck pulls up to school, drone fuselage hanging out.
COOPER: How’s this work? You guys come
with?
TOM: I’ve got class. But she ...
Pats Murph on shoulder.
Needs to wait.
Murph glares at Tom as he hops out.
COOPER: Why? What?
MURPH: Dad, I had a thing ... well,
they’ll tell you about it. Just try
and ...
COOPER: Am I gonna be mad?
MURPH: Not with me. Just try not to -
COOPER: Relax, I got this.
Murph pulls out a notebook. Starts drawing a BARCODE.

INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - LATER (MORNING)

Cooper enters, awkward. The PRINCIPAL (male, fifties) turns
from the window.
PRINCIPAL: Little late, Coop.
(Indicates chair.)
Guess you had to stop off at the
Asian fighter plane store.
COOPER: (sits, smiles)
Actually, sir, it’s a surveillance
drone. With outstanding solar
cells.
11.
Cooper nods at Murph’s teacher, Ms Hanley, thirties,
attractive.
PRINCIPAL: We got Tom’s scores back. He’s
going to make an excellent farmer.
Congratulations.
The Principal slides a paper across the desk.
COOPER: (taken aback)
What about college?
PRINCIPAL: The university only takes a
handful. They don’t have resources
-
COOPER: I’m still paying taxes - where’s
that go? There’s no more armies.
PRINCIPAL: Not to the university. Coop, you
have to be realistic.
COOPER: You’re ruling him out for college
now? He’s fifteen.
PRINCIPAL: Tom’s score simply isn’t high
enough.
COOPER: What’re you? About a
thirty-six-inch waist?
(Beat.)
Thirty-inch inseam?
PRINCIPAL: I’m not sure I see what -
COOPER: You’re telling me you need two
numbers to measure your own ass,
but just one to measure my son’s
future?
Ms Hanley stifles a laugh. The Principal shoots her a look.
12.
PRINCIPAL: You’re a well educated man, Coop. A
trained pilot -
COOPER: And an engineer.
PRINCIPAL: Okay. Well, right now the world
doesn’t need more engineers. We
didn’t run out of planes, or
television sets. We ran out of
food.
Cooper leans back. He’s not going to win this one.
PRINCIPAL: The world needs farmers. Good
farmers, like you. And Tom.
(Smiles benignly.)
We’re a caretaker generation. And
things are getting better. Maybe
your grandchildren -
COOPER: Are we done, sir?
PRINCIPAL: No. Ms Hanley is here to talk about
Murph.
Cooper shifts his gaze to Ms Hanley.
MS HANLEY: Murph’s a bright kid. A wonderful
kid, Mr Cooper. But she’s been
having a little trouble ...
Ms Hanley places a textbook on the desk.
She brought this to school, to show
the other kids the section on the
lunar landings ...
COOPER: Yeah, it’s one of my old textbooks,
she likes the pictures.
MS HANLEY: This is an old federal textbook.
We’ve replaced them with corrected
versions.
13.
COOPER: Corrected?
MS HANLEY: Explaining how the Apollo missions
were faked to bankrupt the Soviet
Union.
COOPER: You don’t believe we went to the
moon?
MS HANLEY: (tolerant smile)
I believe it was a brilliant piece
of propaganda. The Soviets
bankrupted themselves pouring
resources into rockets and other
useless machines.
COOPER: ’Useless machines’?
MS HANLEY: Yes, Mr Cooper. And if we don’t
want a repeat of the wastefulness
and excess of the twentieth
century, our children need to learn
about this planet, not tales of
leaving it.
Cooper considers this in silence. Looks at Ms Hanley.
COOPER: One of those useless machines they
used to make was called an MRI. And
if we had any of them left, the
doctors might have been able to
find the cyst in my wife’s brain
before she died, rather than
afterwards. Then she could be
sitting here listening to this,
which’d be good, cos she was always
the calmer one ...
Ms Hanley looks at Cooper, embarrassed. Then -
MS HANLEY: I’m sorry about your wife, Mr
Cooper. But Murph got into a fist
fight with several of her
classmates over this Apollo
nonsense and we thought it best to
(MORE): 14.
MS HANLEY (cont’d)
bring you in and see what ideas you
might have for dealing with her
behavior on the home front.
COOPER: Sure. Well, there’s a ball game
tomorrow night, and Murph’s going
through a bit of a baseball phase.
There’ll be candy and soda ...
Ms Hanley looks at him, expectant.
COOPER: I think I’ll take her to that.
Ms Hanley turns to the Principal, not happy.

EXT. PICKUP TRUCK OUTSIDE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

Murph looks up from her notebook at her dad, expectantly.
MURPH: How’d it go?
COOPER: I, uh ... got you suspended.
MURPH: What?!
COOPER: Sorry.
MURPH: Dad! I told you not to -
The CB radio CRACKLES to life.
CB OPERATOR: Cooper? Boots for Cooper.
COOPER: Cooper.
BOOTS: (over radio)
Coop, those combines you rebuilt
went haywire.
15.
COOPER: Power the controllers down for a
couple minutes.
BOOTS: (over radio)
Did that. You should come take a
look, it’s kinda weird.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Cooper and Murph pass a slow-moving harvester pulling up to
the house, which is surrounded by AUTOMATED FARM MACHINES.
They’ve nosed up to the house like animals at a Nativity.
Boots, the farm hand, approaches -
BOOTS: One by one they been peeling off
from the fields and heading over.
Cooper pops open the cabin to a harvester. Checks the auto
pilot hooked up to the controls.
BOOTS: Something’s interfering with their
compass ...
Cooper jumps down and heads to the front door. Enters.
BOOTS (O.S.): Magnetism or some such ...

INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Cooper looks at the kitchen. Nothing. Murph comes in.
MURPH: What is it, Dad?
A small BANG from upstairs. Cooper heads up.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Murph’s bedroom clearly used to be her mother’s. Cooper, in
the doorway, looks at the wall of BOOKS opposite - several
GAPS. He looks down at some books on the floor.
MURPH: Nothing special about which books.
(Off look.)
(MORE): 16.
MURPH (cont’d)
Been working on it, like you said.
Murph holds up her notebook with its barcode.
MURPH: I counted the spaces.
COOPER: Why?
MURPH: In case the ghost’s trying to say
something. I’m trying Morse.
COOPER: Morse?
MURPH: Yeah. Dots and dashes, used for -
COOPER: Murph, I know what Morse code is. I
just don’t think your bookshelf’s
trying to talk to you.
He leaves. Murph, embarrassed, turns back to the shelf.

INT. FRONT PORCH, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Donald hands Cooper a beer.
COOPER: Had to reset every compass clock
and GPS to offset for the anomaly.
DONALD: Which is?
COOPER: No idea. If the house was built on
magnetic ore, we’d’ve seen this the
first time we switched on a
tractor.
Donald nods. Sips.
DONALD: Sounds like your meeting at school
didn’t go so well.
17.
COOPER: (sighs)
We’ve forgotten who we are, Donald.
Explorers, pioneers. Not
caretakers.
Donald nods, thoughtful. Weighs up his words.
DONALD: When I was a kid it felt like they
made something new every day. Some
gadget or idea. Like every day was
Christmas. But six billion people
... just try to imagine that. And
every last one of them trying to
have it all.
He turns to Cooper.
This world isn’t so bad. And Tom’ll
do just fine - you’re the one who
doesn’t belong. Born forty years
too late, or forty years too early.
My daughter knew it, God bless her.
And your kids know it. ’Specially
Murph.
COOPER: We used to look up and wonder at
our place in the stars. Now we just
look down and worry about our place
in the dirt.
DONALD: Cooper, you were good at something
and you never got a chance to do
anything with it. I’m sorry. But
that’s not your kids’ fault.
Cooper looks up at the stars above.
OLD-TIMER (V.O.): May 14th. Never forget. Clear as a
bell. You’d never think ...
INSERT CUT: THE OLD-TIMER REMEMBERS. CUT TO A SECOND
OLD-TIMER ...:
SECOND OLD-TIMER: When the first of the real big ones
rolled in ... I thought it was the
end of the world.
18.

EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

The CRACK of ball off bat - a pop-fly caught to a trickle of
applause. Half-filled stands at what looks like a minor
league game.
DONALD: In my day we had real ball players.
Who’re these bums?
As the team runs in from the field we see: NEW YORK YANKEES.
COOPER: Well, in my day people were too
busy fighting over food for
baseball, so consider this
progress.
Murph offers Donald some popcorn.
DONALD: Fine. But popcorn at a ball game is
unnatural. I want a hot dog.
MURPH: (confused)
What’s a hot dog?
Cooper sits with Tom a row in front.
COOPER: The school says you’re gonna follow
in my footsteps. I think that’s
great.
TOM: You think that’s great?
MURPH: You hate farming, Dad. Grandpa
said.
Cooper looks at Donald, who shrugs ’sorry’.
COOPER: What’s important is how you feel
about it, Tom.
TOM: I like what you do. I like our
farm.
19.
On the field: the batter hits one along the ground - it
rolls to an infielder’s foot - but the infielder IGNORES it,
STARING up at the sky. The crowd starts to look up ...
OLD-TIMER (V.O.): You’ve never seen the like. Black.
Just black ...
INSERT CUT: THE OLD-TIMER CHOKES BACK FEAR AS HE REMEMBERS.
Cooper stares at the horizon, where an ENORMOUS BLACK DUST
STORM IS MASSING. People start leaving, tying handkerchiefs
across their faces.
COOPER: Come on, guys.

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper speeds along as Donald and the kids stuff RAGS into
cracks and vents ... behind them the WALL OF BLACK DUST
ADVANCES, SWALLOWING UP ROADS, BUILDINGS. A nasty SOUND is
developing - the truck ROCKING with GUSTS of wind ...
Suddenly, BLACK DUST ENVELOPS the car, LIGHTNING CRACKLING.
DONALD: It’s a bad one ...
COOPER: Mask up, guys.
Murph and Tom take SURGICAL MASKS out of the glove box.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

VISIBILITY MERE FEET as the dust storm BRUTALIZES the farm.
The truck CRAWLS up to the house. Cooper leans in to try and
see better ... CRACK - a panel of sheet metal SMASHES into
the windshield - Cooper turns - wrestles Murph out of the
truck as Donald blindly stumbles towards the front door with
Tom ...

INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The SHUTTERS BANG as the wind WHIPS around the house,
FORCING JETS OF DUST up through cracks in the window frames,
floorboards ... Donald SLAMS the door. Murph is COUGHING ...
Cooper looks around. Sees dust coming from upstairs.
20.
COOPER: Did you both shut your windows?
Tom nods. Murph looks at Cooper. Runs for the stairs.
COOPER: Wait -

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cooper gets to the doorway. Murph stands in the middle of
the room, STARING. Cooper SHUTS the window. The dust hangs
in the relative quiet. Murph is staring, TRANSFIXED, at
LINES where dust is FALLING UNNATURALLY FAST, STREAMING DOWN
through the air, collecting on the floor in a PATTERN -
MURPH: The Ghost.
Cooper STARES at dust collecting like snow on power lines...
COOPER: Grab your pillow, sleep in with
Tom.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN - MORNING

Calm. Dust settled.

INT. TOM’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Murph slips out of bed, wrapped in her blanket. Pads down
the hall, peeks in her bedroom door at -

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cooper sits, staring at the PATTERN of dust: thick radial
lines, like a CIRCULAR BARCODE. Murph sits down next to her
dad. They STARE at it together. He holds up a coin ...
COOPER: It’s not a ghost ...
Cooper tosses the coin across a line. It SHOOTS at the floor
-
It’s gravity.
21.

INT. SAME - LATER

Donald pokes his head in.
DONALD: I’m dropping Tom, then heading to
town ...
(Looks at dust pattern.)
You wanna clean that up when you’ve
finished praying to it?
Cooper reaches for Murph’s notebook. Starts writing ...

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - LATER

Murph fills a glass of water. Picks up a plate of
sandwiches.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Follow Murph into the room, to find Cooper standing there.
COOPER: I got something.
Cooper is pointing to the thick and thin radial lines -
Binary. Thick is one, thin is zero
- it’s numbers ... number pairs...
He holds up the notebook to show Murph the number pairs.
Coordinates.

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper and Murph pore over MAPS. Cooper TOSSES one aside,
lays it out on the table. Finds a spot. Looks up at Murph
...

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper packing his truck - sleeping bag, flashlight ...
MURPH: You can’t leave me behind!
COOPER: Grandpa’s back in two hours.
22.
MURPH: You don’t know what you’re going to
find -
COOPER: That’s why I can’t take you.

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper grabs the maps and a bottle of water. He calls up -
COOPER: Murph?
Nothing.
Murph, just wait here for Grandpa.
Tell him I’ll call him on the
radio.

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper drives, map spread on the wheel, looks for a pen -
reaches over to the passenger wheel well - lifts a BLANKET -
Murph is there -
COOPER:
JESUS!: The truck WOBBLES as Cooper regains control.
Murph, what are you doing?!
Murph is LAUGHING as she climbs into the passenger seat -
COOPER: It’s not funny -
But Murph’s laugh is infectious.
MURPH: You wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t
for me.
Cooper hands Murph the map.
COOPER: Fair enough. Make yourself
useful...
The pickup cruises down the road, heading for the MOUNTAINS.
23.

EXT. PLAINS APPROACHING MOUNTAINS - DUSK

The tiny pickup is dwarfed by the darkening foothills.

EXT. DIRT ROAD OFF MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT

Cooper pulls up to a gate in chain-link fence. Murph is
asleep next to him.
COOPER: Murph. Murph.
Murph wakes.
I think this is as far as we get.
Murph glances out at the fence. Closes her eyes again.
MURPH: Why? You didn’t bring the
bolt-cutters?
COOPER: I like your spirit, young lady.
Cooper gets out of the truck, retrieves his bolt-cutters and
comes up to the fence. He looks up and down the road.
Nothing. He reaches out and puts the jaws of the cutters -
WHAM! SPOTLIGHTS IN COOPER’S EYES - A HARSH ELECTRIC VOICE -
VOICE: STEP AWAY FROM THE FENCE.
Cooper drops the cutters, puts his hands in the air -
COOPER: Don’t shoot! My child is in the
car! I’m unarmed! My daughter is -
Murph watches, terrified as, with a ZAP, Cooper DROPS. Murph
SCRAMBLES back along the seat as MASSIVE FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.
The door is WRENCHED open - a BLINDING LIGHT
VOICE:
DON’T BE AFRAID.: Murph SCREAMS.
24.

INT. BRIGHT, INDUSTRIAL ROOM - LATER

Cooper comes to, sitting in a chair. Opposite him is an
ARTICULATED MACHINE. A VOICE emanates from its side.
MACHINE: How did you find this place?
COOPER: Where’s my daughter?
MACHINE: You had the coordinates for this
facility marked on your map. Where
did you get them?
Cooper leans in to the machine.
COOPER:
WHERE’S MY DAUGHTER?!: Cooper’s scream REVERBERATES. Cooper sizes up the machine.
You might think you’re still in the
Marines, but the Marines don’t
exist anymore, pal. I’ve got grunts
like you mowing my grass ...
The Machine RISES to its full height.
MACHINE: How did you find us?
COOPER: But you don’t look like a lawnmower
to me ... you, I’m gonna turn into
an overqualified vacuum cleaner -
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.): No, you’re not.
Cooper turns to see a businesslike woman in her thirties.
WOMAN: Tars, back down, please.
The machine, TARS, sinks back down.
COOPER: You’re taking a risk using
ex-military for security. They’re
old, their control units are
unpredictable ...
25.
WOMAN: Well, that’s what the government
could spare.
COOPER: Who are you?
WOMAN: Dr Brand.
COOPER: I knew a Dr Brand once. But he was
a professor -
WOMAN (BRAND): What makes you think I’m not?
COOPER: And nowhere near as cute.
BRAND: You think you can flirt your way
out of this mess?
COOPER: (honest, scared)
Dr Brand, I have no idea what this
mess is. I’m scared for my little
girl and I want her by my side.
Then I’ll tell you anything you
want to know. Okay?
Brand considers this. Turns to Tars.
BRAND: Get the principals and the girl
into the conference room.
(To Cooper.)
Your daughter’s fine. Bright kid.
(Rises.)
Must have a very smart mother.

INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper follows Brand into a corridor. Tars LURCHES behind.
COOPER: It’s pretty clear you don’t want
visitors - why not let us back up
from your fence and be on our way?
26.
BRAND: It’s not that simple.
COOPER: Sure it is. I don’t know anything
about you or this place.
BRAND: Yes, you do.
Brand ushers Cooper through a door into a conference room -

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Where an OLD MAN is crouched down, talking to Murph.
MURPH: Dad!
Murph runs into Cooper’s arms. The Old Man SMILES at Cooper.
OLD MAN: Hello, Cooper.
COOPER: (stunned)
Professor Brand?
MAN AT TABLE (DOYLE)
Just take a seat, Mr Cooper.
Cooper and Murph sit at a table where five people are
waiting - a bespectacled man, WILLIAMS, leans forward to
address Cooper.
WILLIAMS: Explain how you found this
facility.
COOPER: Stumbled across it. Looking for
salvage and I saw the fence -
WILLIAMS: You’re sitting in the world’s best
kept secret - you don’t stumble in.
And you certainly don’t stumble
out.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Cooper, please. Cooperate with
these people.
27.
Cooper looks nervously around the room.
COOPER: It’s hard to explain, but we
learned these coordinates from an
anomaly ...
DOYLE: What sort of anomaly?
COOPER: I don’t want to term it
’supernatural’ ... but ...
Cooper is losing them. Williams leans forward. Serious.
WILLIAMS: You’re going to have to, Mr Cooper.
Real quick.
COOPER: After that last storm, it was a
pattern ... in dust ...
MURPH: It was gravity.
All eyes turn to Murph. She’s said the magic word. Doyle
looks at Professor Brand, excited. Turns to Cooper -
DOYLE: Where was this gravitational
anomaly?
COOPER: Look, I’m happy you’re excited
about gravity, but if you want more
answers from us I’m gonna need
assurances -
WILLIAMS: Assurances?
Cooper looks at Murph. Then covers Murph’s ears.
COOPER: That we’re getting out of here ...
and not in the trunk of some car.
Brand laughs. Williams smiles. Cooper looks confused.
28.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Don’t you know who we are, Coop?
COOPER: No. No, I don’t.
BRAND: (points around table)
Williams, Doyle, Jenkins, Smith,
you already know my father,
Professor Brand. We’re NASA.
COOPER:
NASA?:
PROFESSOR BRAND: NASA. Same NASA you flew for.
Now Cooper is laughing, too. Murph looks around, confused.

INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER

Professor Brand shows Cooper the facility.
COOPER: I heard you got shut down for
refusing to drop bombs from the
stratosphere onto starving people.
PROFESSOR BRAND: When they realized killing other
people wasn’t a long term solution
they needed us back. Set us up in
the old NORAD facility. In secret.
COOPER: Why secret?
PROFESSOR BRAND: Public opinion won’t allow spending
on space exploration. Not when
we’re struggling to put food on the
table.
Professor Brand ushers Cooper through a large door -
29.

INT. GREENHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Professor Brand gestures to large PLANTATIONS under glass.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Blight. Wheat seven years ago, okra
this year. Now there’s just corn.
COOPER: But we’re growing more than ever -
PROFESSOR BRAND: Like the potatoes in Ireland, like
the wheat in the dust bowl, the
corn will die. Soon.
Brand enters with Murph. She shows her the greenhouses.
COOPER: We’ll find a way, we always have.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Driven by the unshakable faith that
the Earth is ours.
COOPER: Not just ours, but it is our home.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Earth’s atmosphere is 80 percent
nitrogen. We don’t even breathe
nitrogen.
Professor Brand shows him a blighted stalk.
Blight does. And as it thrives our
air contains less and less oxygen
...
Professor Brand gestures over at Murph ...
The last people to starve will be
the first to suffocate. Your
daughter’s generation will be the
last to survive on Earth.
Cooper looks over at Murph. Then back to Professor Brand.
COOPER: Tell me this is where you explain
how you’re going to save the world.
30.

INT. VAST CIRCULAR CHAMBER (LAUNCH FACILITY) - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper and Professor Brand enter like ants in a grain silo.
A ROCKET is on a pad, DWARFED by the circular chamber. Far
above, a ring of mirrors reflects the dawn down into the
facility.
PROFESSOR BRAND: We’re not meant to save the world
... we’re meant to leave it.
Cooper stares up at the rocket. He recognizes the
arrangement of two CRAFT at the top.
COOPER: Rangers.
PROFESSOR BRAND: The last components of our one
versatile ship in orbit, the
Endurance. Our final expedition.
COOPER: What happened to the other
vehicles?
PROFESSOR BRAND: The Lazarus missions.
COOPER: Sounds cheerful.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Lazarus came back from the dead -
COOPER: He had to die in the first place.
You sent people out there looking
for a new home ...
Professor Brand nods.
There’s no planet in our solar
system that can support life ...
and it’d take them a thousand years
to reach the nearest star - that
doesn’t even qualify as futile ...
Where did you send them, Professor?
PROFESSOR BRAND: Cooper, I can’t tell you any more
unless you agree to pilot this
craft. You’re the best we ever had.
31.
COOPER: I barely left the stratosphere.
PROFESSOR BRAND: This crew’s never left the
simulator. We can’t program this
mission from Earth, we don’t know
what’s out there. We need a pilot.
And this is the mission you were
trained for.
COOPER: Without ever knowing. An hour ago,
you didn’t even know I was still
alive. And you were going anyway.
PROFESSOR BRAND: We had no choice. But something
brought you here. They chose you.
COOPER: Who’s ’they’?
Professor Brand is silent. Cooper wrestles.
How long would I be gone?
PROFESSOR BRAND: Hard to know. Years.
COOPER: I’ve got my kids, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Get out there and save them.
Cooper considers this. Decides.
COOPER: Who’s ’they’?

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

A man in his forties has the solar system up on the screen.
This is ROMILLY.
ROMILLY: We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost fifty years ago.
Mostly small distortions to our
instruments in the upper atmosphere
- I believe you encountered one
yourself ...
32.
COOPER: (realizing)
Over the Straights - my crash -
something tripped my fly-by wire -
ROMILLY: Exactly. But the most significant
anomaly was this ...
Cooper stares at an image of Saturn and its moons. Romilly
zooms in on some stars DISTORTED like ripples in a pond.
ROMILLY: A disturbance of spacetime out near
Saturn.
COOPER: A wormhole?
ROMILLY: It appeared forty-eight years ago.
COOPER: Where does it lead?
PROFESSOR BRAND: Another galaxy.
COOPER: A wormhole isn’t a naturally
occurring phenomenon.
BRAND: Someone placed it there.
COOPER: ’They’.
BRAND: And whoever ’They’ are, they appear
to be looking out for us - that
wormhole lets us travel to other
stars. It came along right as we
needed it.
DOYLE: They’ve put potentially habitable
worlds within our reach. Twelve, in
fact from our initial probes.
COOPER: You sent probes into it?
33.
PROFESSOR BRAND: We sent people into it. Ten years
ago.
COOPER: The Lazarus missions.
Professor Brand rises and moves to a MEMORIAL, pointing -
PROFESSOR BRAND: Twelve possible worlds. Twelve
Ranger launches carrying the
bravest humans ever to live, led by
the remarkable Dr Mann.
DOYLE: Each person’s landing pod had life
support for two years - but they
could use hibernation to stretch
that, making observations on
organics over a decade or more.
Their mission was to assess their
world, and if it showed promise,
send a signal, bed down for the
long nap, and wait to be rescued.
COOPER: And if their world didn’t show
promise?
DOYLE: Hence the bravery.
COOPER: Because you don’t have resources to
visit all twelve.
DOYLE: No. Data transmission back through
the wormhole is rudimentary, simple
binary ’pings’ on an annual basis
to give some clue as to which
worlds have potential. One system
shows promise.
COOPER: One? Kind of a long shot.
BRAND: One system with three potential
worlds ... no long shot.
34.
COOPER: So if we find a new home, what
then?
PROFESSOR BRAND: That’s the long shot. There’s Plan
A and there’s Plan B. Did you
notice anything strange about the
launch chamber ...

INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper cocks his head, puzzling at the VAST chamber ...
there are structures built SIDEWAYS around the CURVED
walls...
COOPER: This whole facility ... it’s a
vehicle? A space station?
PROFESSOR BRAND: Both. We’ve been working on it, and
others like it for twenty-five
years. Plan A.
COOPER: How does it get off the Earth?
PROFESSOR BRAND: Those first gravitational anomalies
changed everything - suddenly we
knew that harnessing gravity was
real. So I started working on the
theory - and we start building this
station.
COOPER: But you haven’t solved it, yet.
PROFESSOR BRAND: That’s why there’s a Plan B.

INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

TECHNICIANS work the complex, high-tech lab. Professor Brand
and Cooper follow Brand to a large glass and steel
apparatus.
BRAND: The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off
(MORE): 35.
BRAND (cont’d)
this planet. This is one way - Plan
B. A population bomb. Almost five
thousand fertilized eggs, weighing
in at under 900 kilos.
COOPER: How could you raise them?
BRAND: With equipment on board we incubate
the first ten. After that, with
surrogacy, the growth becomes
exponential - within thirty years
we might have a colony of hundreds.
The real difficulty of colonization
is genetic diversity,
(Indicates vials.)
This takes care of that.
Cooper looks at the equipment. Unenthusiastic.
COOPER: We just give up on the people here?
PROFESSOR BRAND: That’s why Plan A’s a lot more fun.

INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE

Professor Brand watches Cooper as he gazes over the vast
tracts of ALGEBRA covering every available surface.
COOPER: Where have you got to?
PROFESSOR BRAND: Almost there.
COOPER: Almost? You’re asking me to hang
everything on an ’almost’?
Professor Brand moves close to Cooper.
PROFESSOR BRAND: I’m asking you to trust me.
Cooper looks at the passion in Professor Brand’s eyes.
36.
COOPER: All those years of training - you
never told me.
PROFESSOR BRAND: We can’t always be open about
everything, Coop, even if we want
to be. What can you tell your
children about this mission?
Cooper considers this. Uneasy.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Find us a new home. When you
return, I’ll have solved the
problem of gravity. You have my
word.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE DAY

Donald, on the porch, gets to his feet as he sees Cooper’s
pickup approaching. The truck pulls up. Murph TEARS past
Grandpa into the house - Donald looks at Cooper,
questioning.

INT. HALL OUTSIDE MURPH’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cooper tries to open the door, but Murph has stacked a desk
and chair against it -
COOPER: Murph?
MURPH: Go! If you’re leaving, just go!

EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

Donald looks out at the night, taking it all in.
DONALD: This world never was enough for
you, was it, Coop?
COOPER: I’m not gonna lie to you, Donald -
heading out there is what I feel
born to do and it excites me. That
doesn’t make it wrong.
Donald considers this. Turns to Cooper.
37.
DONALD: It might. Don’t trust the right
thing done for the wrong reason.
The ’why’ of a thing? That’s the
foundation.
COOPER: (sadly)
Well, the foundation’s solid.
(Gestures at landscape.)
We farmers sit here every year when
the rains fail and say ’next year’.
Next year ain’t gonna save us. Nor
the one after. This world’s a
treasure, Donald. But she’s been
telling us to leave for a while
now.
(Stares at the horizon.)
Mankind was born on Earth. It was
never meant to die here.
Donald considers this. Scoops the dust off the rail.
DONALD: Tom’ll be okay. But you have to
make it right with Murph.
COOPER: I will.
DONALD: Without making any promises you
don’t know you can keep.
Cooper meets Donald’s gaze. Looks away, nodding.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Cooper’s hand, reaching in, removes the chair from the desk,
barricading the door. Murph is lying on the bed, turned
away. Cooper pushes the desk back gently. Enters, quietly.
COOPER: You have to talk to me.
Nothing.
I have to fix this before I go.
Murph turns, tear-stained, angry cheeks blazing -
38.
MURPH: Then I’ll keep it broken so you
have to stay.
Cooper sits down on the bed next to Murph.
COOPER: After you kids came along, your
mother said something I didn’t
really understand - she said, ’I
look at the babies and I see myself
as they’ll remember me.’ She said,
’It’s as if we don’t exist anymore,
like we’re ghosts, like now we’re
just there to be memories for our
kids.’ Now I realize - once we’re
parents, we’re just the ghosts of
our childrens’ futures.
MURPH: You said ghosts don’t exist.
COOPER: That’s right. I can’t be your ghost
right now - I need to exist.
Because they chose me. They chose
me, Murph. You saw it. Murph sits
up.
Points at the shelves. The gaps.
MURPH: I figured out the message ...
(Opens her notebook.)
It was Morse code ...
COOPER: Murph -
MURPH: One word. You know what it is?
Cooper shakes his head sadly. Murph holds out her notebook -
’STAY’. It says ’STAY’, Dad.
COOPER: Oh, Murph.
MURPH: You don’t believe me?! Look the
books! Look at -
Cooper takes his daughter in his arms ...
39.
COOPER: It’s okay, it’s okay ...
Murph buries her head on Cooper’s shoulder, sobbing.
Murph, a father looks in his
child’s eyes and thinks - maybe
it’s them ... maybe my child will
save the world. And everyone, once
a child, wants to look into their
own dad’s eyes and know he saw how
they saved some little corner of
their world. But, usually, by then,
the father is gone.
MURPH: Like you will be.
Cooper looks at his daughter. Lies with head, not heart:
COOPER: No. I’m coming back.
MURPH: When?
Cooper reaches into his pocket. Pulls out two WATCHES.
COOPER: One for you. One for me.
Murph takes the watch, curious. Cooper holds up his watch.
When I’m in hyper-sleep, or travel
near the speed of light, or near a
black hole, time will change for
me. It’ll run more slowly. When I
get back we’ll compare.
MURPH: Time will run differently for us?
COOPER: Yup. By the time I get back we
might even be the same age. You and
me. Imagine that ...
Murph takes this in. Cooper sees he’s made a mistake.
Wait, Murph -
MURPH: You have no idea when you’re coming
back.
Cooper looks at his daughter.
40.
MURPH: No idea at all!
Murph THROWS the watch - TURNS HER BACK.
COOPER: Don’t make me leave like this.
Nothing.
Please. I have to go now.
Murph will not turn around. Cooper tries to rest his hand on
the back of her head, but she shakes it off.
COOPER: I love you, Murph. Forever. And I’m
coming back.
Cooper walks slowly out. A BOOK DROPS FROM THE SHELF. Cooper
turns to look at it. Then leaves.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper, mechanical, puts his small bag in the truck.
DONALD: How’d it go?
COOPER: Fine. It was fine.
Cooper turns to Tom. Hugs him. Tight enough for both kids.
I love you, Tom.
TOM: Travel safe, Dad.
COOPER: (indicates farm)
Look after our place, you hear?
TOM: Can I use your truck while you’re
gone?
COOPER: (smiles)
I’ll make sure they bring it back
for you.
Cooper gets in. Starts the engine.
Mind my kids for me, Donald.
41.
Donald nods. Cooper pulls out.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Murph jumps off the bed, GRABS the watch, RUNS downstairs.

INT. PICKUP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

As Cooper drives he lifts the blanket in the wheel-well
where Murph hid last time. Nothing. And we hear a
COUNTDOWN...:
VOICE:
(O.S.): TEN ... NINE ...

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Murph RACES out of the house, watch in hand -
MURPH: Dad?! DAD?!
VOICE:
(V.O.): EIGHT ... SEVEN ...
But Cooper is a dust trail far down the road.
VOICE:
(O.S.): SIX ... FIVE ...
Murph SOBS as her grandpa puts his arms around her ...

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DUSTY PLAIN - CONTINUOUS

As Cooper drives away tears roll down his cheeks
VOICE:
(O.S.): FOUR ... THREE ... TWO ... ONE ...
42.

INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY

VOICE:
(O.S.):
IGNITION.: FIRE SHOOTS FROM THE BASE OF THE ROCKET ... The rocket RISES
slowly from the pad, up into the sky ...

INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper, in his space helmet, lets the FORCE of the rocket
vibrate through him ...
VOICE:
(O.S.): Stage one ... SEPARATION.
Cooper starts to see the Earth’s curve through the window...
VOICE:
(O.S.): Stage two ... SEPARATION.
And Cooper shakes loose the bonds of Earth.

EXT. UPPER ATMOSPHERE - CONTINUOUS

The rocket RIPS upwards into the sky.

INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper glances around the vibrating, cramped cockpit -
Brand, Doyle, Romilly, Tars. Tars spots Cooper’s glance -
TARS: All here, Mr Cooper. Plenty of
slaves for my robot colony.
Cooper looks at him, confused.
DOYLE: They gave him a humor setting so
he’d fit in with his unit better.
He thinks it relaxes us.
COOPER: A massive, sarcastic robot. What a
great idea.
43.
TARS: I have a cue light I can turn on
when I’m joking, if you like.
COOPER: Probably help.
TARS: You can use it to find your way
back to the ship after I blow you
out the airlock.
Tars looks at Cooper. A beat. An LED turns on. Cooper shakes
his head.
COOPER: What’s your humor setting, Tars?
TARS: One hundred percent.
Cooper turns to the instruments -
COOPER: Take it to seventy-five, please.
EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS
The Rangers streak across the Earth, settle into a low
orbit.

INT. RANGER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Quiet. Cooper stares down at the continents sliding by. He
looks over at Brand who is doing the same, abstracted.
COOPER: We’ll get back.
She stares at the land. The oceans.
It’s hard. Leaving everything. My
kids ... your father ...
BRAND: We’re going to spend a lot of time
together ...
COOPER: (nods)
We should learn to talk.
44.
BRAND: And when not to.
(Off look.)
Just trying to be honest.
COOPER: Maybe you don’t need to be that
honest.
(Turns to Tars.)
Tars, what’s your honesty
parameter?
Tars DISENGAGES from the floor and MOVES to the rear airlock
-
TARS: Ninety percent.
COOPER: Ninety? What kind of robot are you?
TARS: Absolute honesty isn’t always the
most diplomatic, or safe form of
communication with emotional
beings.
Cooper turns to Brand. Shrugs.
COOPER: Ninety percent honesty it is, then.
Brand looks at Cooper. Can’t help smiling.
VOICE: (over radio)
Sixty seconds out...

EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS

The Rangers approach a RING MODULE, fire retro-thrusters and
slide gracefully into the center of the ring - the last
piece of a large modular craft: the U.S.S. ENDURANCE. Four
LANDERS (including the Rangers) are nestled inside the ring
module.
45.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - MOMENTS LATER

Brand, Doyle and Romilly, following Tars, FLOAT through the
cramped cabins, powering up. Tars powers up a second
articulated machine, CASE.
DOYLE: Cooper, you should have control.

INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE (RANGER) - CONTINUOUS

Cooper checks instruments -
COOPER: Talking fine. Ready to spin?

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Doyle and Romilly are strapped in - Brand grabs a handhold -

INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

BRAND: (over radio)
All set.
Cooper hits a switch ...

EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS

Thrusters silently fire on the Endurance. It starts
ROTATING.:

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

The crew members settle in as gravity is established.
Romilly is clearly struggling to find his sea legs in the
rotating ship.
BRAND: You okay there?
ROMILLY: Yup. Just need a little time -
BRAND: There should be Dramamine in the
hab pod.
46.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - LATER

The crew listen to Professor Brand over the video link -
PROFESSOR BRAND: (on screen)
I miss you already. Amelia, be
safe. Give my regards to Dr Mann.
BRAND: I will, Dad.
PROFESSOR BRAND: (on screen)
Things look good for your
trajectory. We’re calculating two
years to Saturn.
ROMILLY: That’s a lot of Dramamine ...
Cooper thinks about two years. What it means to his kids.
COOPER: (on screen)
Keep an eye on my family, sir.
Specially Murph. She’s a smart one.
PROFESSOR BRAND: (on screen)
We’ll be waiting when you get back
...

INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE - LATER

Cooper and Doyle flick switches and check instruments -
PROFESSOR BRAND:
(V.O.): ... A little older. A little wiser.
But happy to see you ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Brand, Romilly, Tars and Case strap in.
PROFESSOR BRAND:
(V.O.): ’Do not go gentle into that good
night ...’
47.

INT. COCKPIT, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Cooper turns to Doyle. HITS the thrusters.

EXT. EARTH ORBIT - CONTINUOUS

Endurance’s main engines FIRE. The craft PUSHES out of orbit
-
PROFESSOR BRAND:
(V.O.): ’Rage, rage against the dying of
the light.’ God speed, Endurance.
The craft accelerates away from Earth.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY

The crew sets up their CRYO-BEDS. Cooper looks out at the
diminishing Earth floating in the void. Brand joins him.
COOPER: So alone.
BRAND: We’ve got each other - Dr Mann had
it worse.
COOPER: (points at Earth)
I meant them. Look at that perfect
planet. We’re not gonna find
another one like her.
BRAND: No. This isn’t like looking for a
new condo - the human race is going
to be adrift ... desperate for a
rock to cling to while they catch
their breaths. We have to find that
rock. Our three prospects are at
the edge of what might sustain
human life.
Brand shows him a blurry image of a dark blue planet.
Laura Miller’s first. She started
our biology program.
She shows him a red world, just a tiny dot.
And Wolf Edmunds is here.
Cooper hears something in her voice.
48.
COOPER: Who’s Edmunds?
BRAND: (fondly)
Wolf’s a particle physicist.
COOPER: None of them had family?
BRAND: No attachments. My father insisted.
They knew the odds against ever
seeing another human being. I’m
hoping we surprise at least three
of them.
COOPER: Tell me about Dr Mann.
Brand replaces the screen image for a grainy, white orb.
BRAND: Remarkable. The best of us. My
father’s protégé. He inspired
eleven people to follow him on the
loneliest journey in human history.
Scientists, explorers ... That’s
what I love - out there we face
great odds. Death. But not evil.
COOPER: Nature can’t be evil?
BRAND: Formidable, frightening - not evil.
Is a tiger evil because it rips a
gazelle to pieces?
COOPER: Just what we bring with us, then.
BRAND: This crew represents the best
aspects of humanity.
COOPER: Even me?
Brand looks at him. Smiles.
49.
BRAND: Hey, we agreed, ninety percent.
Brand moves to her cryo-bed. Cooper looks out at space.
BRAND: Don’t stay up too late. We can’t
spare the resources.
COOPER: Hey, I’ve been waiting a long time
to be up here -
BRAND: You are literally wasting your
breath.
Cooper nods at her. Joins Tars.
COOPER: Show me the trajectory again.
TARS: Eight months to Mars, then
counter-orbital slingshot around -
Brand’s cryo-bed darkens.
COOPER: (whisper)
Tars? Was Dr Brand -
TARS: Why are you whispering? You can’t
wake them.
COOPER: Were Dr Brand and Edmunds ...
close?
TARS: I wouldn’t know.
COOPER: Is that ninety percent, or ten
percent ’wouldn’t know’?
TARS: I also have a discretion setting.
COOPER: So I gather ...
(Rises.)
(MORE): 50.
COOPER (cont’d)
But not a poker face.
Tars watches Cooper head for the comm. station. He sits down
to record a message. Awkward. Stuck. He dives in -
Hey, guys. I’m about settle down
for the long nap, so I figured I’d
send you an update ...

EXT. OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS

The Endurance slips away from the small blue planet ...
COOPER:
(V.O.): The Earth looks amazing from here
... you can’t see any of the dust -

EXT. CORNFIELDS - DAY

A line of dust slides across the shimmering horizon.
COOPER:
(V.O.): Hope you guys are doing great. This
should get to you okay ...

EXT. FRONT PORCH, FARMHOUSE - DAY

Donald watches two approaching vehicles kick up dust.
COOPER:
(V.O.): Professor Brand said he’d make sure
of it. Guess I’ll say good night.
Donald recognizes Cooper’s truck ... Murph BURSTS out of the
house -
MURPH: (quiet)
Is it him?
DONALD: I don’t think so, Murph.
Donald rises to meet the truck. Professor Brand gets out.
51.
PROFESSOR BRAND: You must be Donald. Hello, Murph.
MURPH: Why’re you in my dad’s truck?
PROFESSOR BRAND: He wanted me to bring it for your
brother.
Silence. Professor Brand reaches into his briefcase.
He sent you a message -
Murph TURNS and goes back into the house. Donald takes a
disc from Professor Brand.
DONALD: Pretty upset with him for leaving.
PROFESSOR BRAND: If you record messages, I’ll
transmit them to Cooper.
Donald nods. Professor Brand looks up at the house.
Murph’s a bright spark. Maybe I
could fan the flame.
DONALD: She’s already making fools of her
teachers. She should come make a
fool out of you.
Professor Brand smiles. Donald looks up into the blue.
Where are they?
PROFESSOR BRAND: Heading towards Mars ...

EXT. MARS - DAY

The Endurance streaks away from Mars ...
PROFESSOR BRAND:
(V.O.): Next time we hear from Cooper,
they’ll be coming up on Saturn.
52.

EXT. SATURN - DAY

The Endurance settles into an orbit around the ringed giant.
TOM:
(O.S.): But they said I can start advanced
agriculture a year early ...

INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Cooper, blanket around his shoulders, watches a highly
compressed video of Tom -
TOM: Got to go, Dad. Hope you’re safe up
there.
Tom makes way for Donald:
DONALD: I’m sorry, Coop, I asked Murph to
say hi, but she’s stubborn as her
old man. I’ll try again next time,
stay safe.
The video cuts out. Cooper gets up, puts a pair of EAR BUDS
in his ears and heads into -
OMITTED:

INT. HAB POD, RING MODULE - LATER

Cooper enters. Romilly is staring out the window.
COOPER: You good, Rom?
Romilly looks at Cooper.
ROMILLY: It gets to me, Coop. This tin can.
Radiation, vacuum outside -
everything wants us dead. We’re
just not supposed to be here.
Cooper looks at him, sympathetic.
53.
COOPER: We’re explorers, Rom, on the
greatest ocean of all.
Romilly bangs on the side of the ship.
ROMILLY: Millimeters of aluminium. That’s
it. And nothing within millions of
miles that won’t kill us in
seconds.
COOPER: A lot of the finest solo yachtsmen
couldn’t swim. They knew if they
went overboard that was it, anyway.
This is no different.
Romilly considers this. Cooper passes him his ear buds -
COOPER: Here -
And the sounds of a THUNDERSTORM wash over Romilly, sounds
that take us to ...

EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS

The Endurance is a tiny speck before the ringed gassy giant.

INT. NAVIGATION, RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Cooper looks over Doyle’s shoulder - he’s flicking through
images of star fields, distorted as if through a fish-eye
lens.
COOPER: From the relay probe?
DOYLE: It was in orbit around the wormhole
- each time it swung around we got
images of the other side of the
foreign galaxy.
COOPER: Like swinging a periscope around?
DOYLE: Exactly.
54.
COOPER: So we’ve got a pretty good idea
what we’re gonna find on the other
side?
DOYLE: Navigationally.
Brand approaches.
BRAND: We’ll be coming up on the wormhole
in less than forty-five. Suit up.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - LATER

Cooper straps in, peering out at the inky blackness past
Saturn. Romilly joins him there, excited.
COOPER: (over radio)
Strap in - I’m killing the spin ...

EXT. SATURN - CONTINUOUS

As the Endurance streaks past Saturn, it stops rotating,
headed for a DISTORTED BLUR of stars.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

ROMILLY: There!
He points at the SPHERICAL blur of stars.
ROMILLY: That’s it! That’s the wormhole!
COOPER: Say it, don’t spray it, Rom.
ROMILLY: Cooper, this is a portal, cutting
through spacetime -
(Points.)
We’re seeing into the heart of a
galaxy so far away we don’t even
know where it is in the universe.
Cooper stares at the wormhole as they approach: a massive
spherical lens into another galaxy.
55.
COOPER: It’s a sphere.
ROMILLY: Of course it is. You thought it
would be just a hole?
COOPER: No ... well, in all the
illustrations -
Romilly grabs a piece of paper, draws two points, far apart
-
ROMILLY: In the illustrations they’re trying
to show you how it works -
He pokes a hole in one point with his pen ...
So they say ’You wanna go from here
to there but it’s too far? A
wormhole bends space like this ...’
He folds the paper over and jams the pen through the second
point, connecting them.
ROMILLY: ’So you can take a shortcut across
a higher dimension.’ But to show
that, they’ve turned
three-dimensional space ...
(Gestures around.)
Into two dimensions.
(Hold up paper.)
Which turns the wormhole into two
dimensions ... a circle.
(Indicates hole in paper.)
But what’s a circle in three
dimensions?
COOPER: A sphere.
ROMILLY: Exactly.
(Points out window.)
It’s a spherical hole ...
Cooper marvels at the concept. And at the looming sphere ...
And who put it here? Who do we
thank?
56.
COOPER: I’m not thanking anyone till we get
through it in one piece.
OMITTED:

EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS

As the Endurance SWINGS around the wormhole, the view of the
foreign galaxy SWINGS in opposition, like an ENORMOUS
SHAVING MIRROR ... it’s extremely disorienting.
The Endurance fires retro-thrusters to slow, descending
towards the wormhole ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper is at the controls. Doyle is next to him.
COOPER: Any trick to this?
DOYLE: No one knows.
COOPER: (glances at Doyle)
But the others made it, right?
DOYLE: At least some of them.
COOPER: Thanks for the confidence boost.
Cooper stares down into the vast lens of the wormhole.
Everybody ready to say goodbye to
our solar system?
ROMILLY: (over radio)
To our galaxy ...
Cooper pushes the sticks forward, nosing down and letting
gravity PULL them towards the center of the wormhole ...
57.

EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS

The Endurance reaches the surface of the wormhole. As it
crosses the threshold it becomes apparent that THERE IS NO
SURFACE ... the craft simply passes into the space of the
distortion, its own warped reflection flickering towards it
as if the ship were leaning into a giant shaving mirror ...

INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper and Doyle stare at the distortion of space ahead ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Brand and Romilly look out at reflections bordering the bulk
- a space beyond our three dimensions ...

EXT. WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS

The Endurance moves through a TUNNEL OF DISTORTED
REFLECTIONS, seeming to gather more and more dizzying speed,
but getting no closer to the far mouth, as if on an
accelerating treadmill -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper, awestruck, checks his instruments -
DOYLE: They won’t help you in here. We’re
cutting through the bulk - space
beyond our three dimensions ...
(Checks his equipment.)
All we can do is record and
observe.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Brand JUMPS - a shape in the air in front of her is BENDING,
warping to form ripples in spacetime inside the cabin -
Romilly STARES at the distortion -
ROMILLY: What is that?!
Brand watches the distortion move towards her -
58.
BRAND: I think - I think it’s them.
ROMILLY: Distorting spacetime? Don’t -!
Brand is reaching out towards the warped space - it MOVES
towards her, DISTORTING her hand - but Brand is not in pain
...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper and Doyle watch the tunnel mouth STREAK towards them,
a mass of stars and nebulae GROWING ...

EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS

The Endurance slides out of the wormhole.

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Suddenly, the instruments are chirping -
DOYLE: We’re ... here.
Cooper and Doyle look out at the new galaxy ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Brand’s hand is back to normal. She stares at her fingers.
ROMILLY: What was that?
Brand flexes her fingers, delighted.
BRAND: The first handshake.

EXT. FAR SIDE OF THE WORMHOLE - CONTINUOUS

The cosmos is more CROWDED here - STAR upon STAR, NEBULAE
...
59.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - LATER

Doyle calls up data on a workstation -
DOYLE: The lost communications came
through -
BRAND: How?
DOYLE: The relay on this side cached them.
Doyle flicks through data -
Years of basic data - no real
surprises. Miller’s site has kept
pinging thumbs up, as has Mann ...
but Edmunds went down, three years
ago.
BRAND: Transmitter failure?
DOYLE: Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right till it went dark.
ROMILLY: Miller still looks good?
Doyle nods. Romilly is drawing on a whiteboard -
She’s coming up fast ... with one
complication - the planet is much
closer to Gargantua than we
thought.
COOPER: Gargantua?
DOYLE: A very large black hole. Miller’s
and Dr Mann’s planets orbit it.
BRAND: And Miller’s is on the horizon?
ROMILLY: A basketball around the hoop.
Landing there takes us dangerously
close. A black hole that big has a
huge gravitational pull.
Cooper glances around the concerned faces -
60.
COOPER: Look, I can swing around that
neutron star to decelerate -
BRAND: It’s not that, it’s time. That
gravity will slow our clock
compared to Earth’s. Drastically.
COOPER: How bad?
ROMILLY: Every hour we spend on that planet
will be maybe ... seven years back
on Earth.
COOPER: Jesus -
ROMILLY: That’s relativity, folks.
COOPER: We can’t drop down there without
considering the consequences.
DOYLE: Cooper, we have a mission - COOPER
That’s easy for you to say - you
don’t have anyone back on Earth
waiting for you, do you?
DOYLE: You have no idea what’s easy for
me.
BRAND: Cooper’s right. We have to think of
time as a resource, just like
oxygen and food. Going down there
is going to cost us.
Doyle steps up to the screen, points out three planets.
DOYLE: Look, Dr Mann’s data is promising,
but we won’t get there for months.
Edmunds is even further. Miller
hasn’t sent much, but what she has
sent is promising - water, organics
...
61.
BRAND: You don’t find that every day.
DOYLE No, you do not. So think
about the resources it would take
to come back here ...
They look at each other, considering. Cooper turns to
Romilly -
COOPER: How far off the planet do we have
to stay to be out of the time
shift?
Romilly indicates a spot on his white board.
ROMILLY: Just back from the cusp.
COOPER: So we track a wider orbit of
Gargantua, parallel with Miller’s
planet but a little further out ...
take a Ranger down, grab Miller and
her samples, debrief and analyze
back here
BRAND: That’ll work.
COOPER: No time for monkey business down
there - Tars, you’d better wait up
here. Who else?
ROMILLY: If we’re talking about a couple
years - I’d use that time to work
on gravity - observations from the
wormhole. That’s gold to Professor
Brand.
COOPER: Okay. Tars, factor an orbit of
Gargantua - minimal thrusting -
conserve fuel - but stay in range.
TARS: Don’t worry, I wouldn’t leave you
behind ...
(Swivels around.)
Dr Brand.
She smiles at him.
62.

EXT. BLACK HOLE, GARGANTUA - DAY

A black sphere sucking light from the cosmos, visible by its
distorting effect on the light of stars behind it - squeezed
into a GLOWING, CURVED HORIZON. The Endurance approaches.

INT. RANGER COCKPIT - DAY

Cooper looks out at Gargantua. Doyle peers over his shoulder
DOYLE: A literal heart of darkness ...
Brand points to a small glowing planet nearer the blackness.
BRAND: There’s Miller’s planet.
Cooper turns to Case, the machine riding shotgun.
COOPER: Ready?
CASE: Yup.
COOPER: Don’t say much, do you?
CASE: Tars talks plenty for both of us.
Cooper chuckles as he throws a final switch -
COOPER: Detach -

EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger DETACHES from the ring module, like an X-1 from a
B-29, FIRES retro-thrusters to slow and ... DROPS -

EXT. THE BLACK HOLE, GARGANTUA - DAY

The Ranger SHOOTS down towards Gargantua -
63.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper is in awe at their acceleration -
COOPER: (into radio)
Romilly, you reading these forces?

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Romilly studies data, marveling.
ROMILLY: Unbelievable.
(Looks out at Gargantua.)
If we could see the collapsed star
inside, the singularity, we’d solve
gravity.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper looks down at the eerie blackness sliding beneath -
COOPER: No way to get anything from it?
ROMILLY: (over radio)
Nothing escapes that horizon. Not
even light. The answer’s there,
just no way to see it.

EXT. GARGANTUA - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger looks tiny as it STREAKS over the blackness, high
above the GLOWING HORIZON. It is approaching Miller’s
planet, a gleaming dark-blue world ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper studies his trajectory.
CASE: This is fast for atmospheric entry.
Should we use the thrusters to
slow?
64.
COOPER: We’re gonna use the Ranger’s
aerodynamics to save the fuel.
CASE: Air brake?
COOPER: Wanna get in fast, don’t we?
CASE: Brand, Doyle, get ready.

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger STREAKS down towards the planet. It starts to
encounter the STRATOSPHERE -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

The craft starts to HOWL and SHAKE. Cooper studies the
curving horizon, concentrating -
CASE: We should ease -
COOPER: Hands where I can see them, Case!
Only time I ever went down was a
machine easing at the wrong moment
-
CASE: A little caution -
COOPER: Can get you killed, same as
reckless.
DOYLE: Cooper! Too damn fast!
COOPER: I got this.
Cooper squeezes the shaking controls with white knuckles -
CASE: Should I disable the feedback?
65.
COOPER: No! No, I need to feel the air ...

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger glows WHITE HOT, slicing through FLAT CLOUDS -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper peers out at the razor-like layers of cloud -
COOPER: Do we have a fix on the beacon?
CASE: Got it. Can you maneuver?
COOPER: Gotta shave more speed. I’ll try
and spiral down on it -
Doyle looks at Brand, nervous. She takes a breath.

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger CUTS through cloud formations, BURSTING out into
CLEARER AIR, HIGH ABOVE AN ENDLESS OCEAN -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

The crew peer at SPARKLING WATER, streaking below them -
DOYLE: Just water.
BRAND: The stuff of life ...
CASE: Twelve hundred meters out.
Cooper BANKS sharply, eases down.
BRAND: It’s shallow. Feet deep ...
66.

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger is low now, kicking up backwash -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

CASE: Seven hundred meters ...
Cooper peers ahead -
COOPER: Wait for it ...
CASE: Five hundred meters ...
Cooper YANKS the stick -
COOPER: Fire!

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger’s retro-rockets FIRE - killing the craft’s speed
just feet from the surface. Water SPRAYS UP as the Ranger
SLEWS diagonally, gear is lowered, the Ranger drops, its
landing gear holding it just above the shallow water.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Everyone BOUNCES with the impact. Then BREATHES.
BRAND: Very graceful.
COOPER: No. But it was very efficient.
(Looks at them.)
What’re you waiting for? Go!
Brand and Doyle hurry out of their harnesses, helmets on.
Case moves to the hatch. With a CRACK, the hatch opens and
LIGHT and SPRAY whip inside ...
67.

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)

Case climbs quickly from the craft, knee deep in the water.
Brand and Doyle follow. Case TRACKS the beacon.
CASE: This way, about two hundred meters.
Brand and Doyle peer into the distance. Smooth, ankle-deep
water to the horizon, where a distant MOUNTAIN RANGE LOOMS.
They start splashing towards it in their heavy spacesuits
...
DOYLE: (panting)
The gravity’s punishing ...
BRAND: Floating through space too long?
CASE: One hundred and thirty percent
Earth gravity.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper listens to their chatter, IMPATIENT.
COOPER: (under his breath)
Come on ...

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

Doyle falls behind. Brand pushes on. Ahead, Case stops.
CASE: Should be here.
Brand joins him, searching the shallows for some sign of
Miller’s mission. She looks up, confused.
BRAND: If the signal’s coming from here -
Case DROPS to his knees THRASHING under the water, like a
bear fishing. Doyle arrives -
DOYLE: What’s he doing?
68.

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper notices something. In the distance. The mountains -

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

Case WRENCHES a piece of DAMAGED EQUIPMENT from the sea bed.
BRAND: Her beacon ...
Case starts lugging the beacon to the Ranger.
DOYLE: Wreckage. Where’s the rest ...?
BRAND: Towards the mountains!
She starts moving fast towards some FLOATING OBJECTS.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper is staring out at the horizon -
COOPER: Those aren’t mountains ...

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

Brand pauses -
COOPER: (over radio)
They’re waves -
Brand looks closer - the ’mountains’ are moving, tiny lines
of white sea spray are blowing from the tops ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper looks the other direction ... there is a MOUNTAIN
WAVE BEARING DOWN ON THE SHIP ...
69.

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

Brand is searching the wreckage -.
COOPER: (over radio)
Brand, get back here!
BRAND: We need the recorder -
Doyle looks from Brand to Case, who is loading the beacon.
Beyond him Doyle sees the mountain wave approaching -
DOYLE: Case, go get her!

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper hits the dash, frustrated.
COOPER: Dammit! Brand, get back here!

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

Brand sloshes along, checking DEBRIS -
BRAND: We can’t leave without her data -
COOPER: (over radio)
You don’t have time!
Case is back at Doyle.
DOYLE: Go, go!
Case takes off towards Brand, who is trying to lift a piece
of equipment from the water. She drops it and moves on -

EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper swings open the hatch, stands in the doorway, peering
out at the approaching mountain waves - turns back to Brand
-
70.
COOPER: Get back here! Now!
Brand has pulled something heavy from the wreckage - she
SLIPS, the wreckage PINNING her down ... She looks back at
the Ranger - sees the mountain wave THOUSANDS OF FEET HIGH
ALMOST UPON THEM -
BRAND: Cooper, go! Go! I can’t make it!
Cooper looks at Case RACING towards her -
COOPER: Get up, Brand!
BRAND: GO! GET OUT OF HERE!
Case THROWS her onto his back and starts running. Doyle
stands, mesmerized by the sheer liquid mountain face ...
COOPER: Doyle! Come on! Case has her!
Doyle turns, starts sloshing back, the water RUNNING against
his ankles now ... Two hundred yards behind, Case POUNDS
through the shallows, Brand on his back -
Cooper looks up at the EVER CLOSER MOUNTAIN WAVE - jumps
inside.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper powers up, as the wall of liquid fills his view.
COOPER: Come on, come on ...
He sees the water right upon them - RUNS back to the hatch.
Doyle is at the foot of the ladder, Case RUNNING FAST.
DOYLE: Go!
Case JUMPS up the ladder, THROWS Brand inside - TURNS for
Doyle. The Ranger TILTS, RISES - DOYLE IS RIPPED FROM CASE’S
HAND - WATER RAGES ACROSS THE OPEN HATCH -
COOPER: Shut the hatch!
Case shuts the hatch. Cooper is throwing switches -
71.
COOPER: Power down! Power down! We have to
ride it out!
(To Brand, furious.)
We are not prepared for this!

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

Doyle is DRAGGED under and away. The Ranger is SUCKED
SIDEWAYS up the face of the mountain -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Brand and Cooper are thrown across the cockpit. Case GRABS
Brand, pulls her into her seat - Cooper holds on as the
craft ROLLS and ROLLS -

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger reaches the top of the wave, rocks upright -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper drops into his seat as the water pours off the canopy
-

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger tilts over the backside of the wave, SURFING for
a second then PITCHING FORWARD - TUMBLING DOWN 8,000 FEET
...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

They hang on for dear life, THRASHED MERCILESSLY -

EXT. MILLER’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger comes AGROUND as the wave leaves it behind ...
72.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

The craft comes to rest. Cooper jumps to the controls,
powers up the electrics. The engines won’t respond -

EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS

The gear LIFTS the Ranger. Water FLOODS out -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper tries the engines again. Nothing.
CASE: Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
COOPER: (hits console)
GODDAMN!:
BRAND: I told you to leave me.
COOPER: And I told you to get your ass back
here! Difference is, only one of us
was thinking about the mission -
BRAND: Cooper, you were thinking about
getting home - I was trying to do
the right thing!
COOPER: Tell that to Doyle.
Quiet. Cooper looks down at the clock. Bitter.
How long to drain, Case?
CASE: Forty-five to an hour.
Cooper shakes his head. Pulls his helmet off.
COOPER: The stuff of life, huh? What’s this
gonna cost us, Brand?
BRAND: A lot. Decades.
Cooper rubs his face. Mind reeling. Trying to breathe.
73.
COOPER: What happened to Miller?
BRAND: Judging by the wreckage, she was
broken up by a wave soon after
impact.
COOPER: How could the wreckage still be
together after all these years?
BRAND: Because of the time slippage. On
this planet’s time, she landed here
just hours ago. She might’ve only
died minutes ago.
Case indicates the beacon.
CASE: The data Doyle received was just
the initial status, echoing
endlessly.
Cooper takes this in. Breathes hard. Takes off his gloves.
COOPER: We’re not prepared for this, Brand.
You’re a bunch of eggheads without
the survival skills of a boy-scout
troop.
BRAND: We got this far on our brains -
farther than any humans in history
-
COOPER: Not far enough. And we’re stuck
here till there won’t be anyone
left on Earth to save -
BRAND: I’m counting every second, same as
you, Cooper.
Cooper takes this in. They’re in the same boat.
COOPER: Don’t you have some clever way we
jump into a black hole and get back
the years?
74.
She shakes her head, dismissive.
COOPER: Don’t just shake your head at me -!
BRAND: Time is relative - it can stretch
and squeeze - but it can’t run
backwards. The only thing that can
move across dimensions like time is
gravity.
COOPER: (thinks)
The beings who led us here ... they
communicate through gravity ...
Brand nods.
Could they be talking to us from
the future?
BRAND: (considers)
Maybe ...
COOPER: Well, if they can -
BRAND: Look, Cooper, they’re creatures of
at least five dimensions - to them
time may be just another physical
dimension. To them the past might
be a canyon they can climb into and
the future a mountain they can can
climb up ... but to us it’s not,
okay?
Brand pulls her helmet off. Looks Cooper in the eyes.
BRAND: I’m sorry, Cooper. I screwed up.
But you knew about relativity.
COOPER: My daughter was ten. I couldn’t
explain Einstein’s theories before
I left.
BRAND: Could you tell her you were going
to save the world?
75.
COOPER: No. I wasn’t much of a parent, but
I understood the most important
thing - let your kids feel safe.
Which rules out telling a
ten-year-old that the world’s
ending.
CASE: Cooper?
Case is pointing out at another MOUNTAIN RANGE.
COOPER: How long for the engines?
CASE: A minute or two -
COOPER: We don’t have it!
The mountain wave is approaching. Cooper tries the engines -

EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS

The rockets COUGH and steam ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper tries the engines again. Close. But no ignition.
COOPER: Helmets on!
The wave is upon them ...
COOPER: Blow our cabin oxygen through the
main thrusters. We’ll spark it -
Case hits a button - a HISS and SHRIEK of gas escaping ...
Brand seals her helmet just as the cockpit DEPRESSURIZES -
COOPER: Come on, now ...
Cooper hits the engines - they BLAST TO LIFE -
76.

EXT. RANGER - CONTINUOUS

A fiery BLAST sends the Ranger clear of the mountain wave.
Down below, Doyle’s body lies in the shallows, about to be
swept up into the next rush of water ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY

Romilly watches as Cooper and Brand enter the Endurance.
BRAND: Hello, Rom.
ROMILLY: I’ve waited years.
COOPER: How many years?
ROMILLY: By now ... it must be -
TARS: Twenty-three years ...
Cooper’s head lowers.
TARS: ... four months, eight days.
Cooper turns away.
ROMILLY: Doyle?
Brand’s eyes flicker down. She shakes her head. She grasps
Romilly’s hands, looks up into his eyes, vulnerable -
BRAND: I thought I was prepared. I knew
all the theory. Reality’s
different.
ROMILLY: And Miller?
BRAND: There’s nothing here for us.
Brand looks at Romilly’s wrinkles. His greying beard.
77.
BRAND: Why didn’t you sleep?
ROMILLY: I did a couple of stretches. But I
stopped believing you were coming
back, and something seems wrong
about dreaming your life away. I
learned what I could from studying
the black hole, but I couldn’t send
anything to your father. We’ve been
receiving, but nothing gets out.
She looks up at Romilly, not wanting to ask ...
BRAND: Is he still alive?
Romilly nods. Brand closes her eyes with relief.
ROMILLY: We’ve got years of messages stored
...
Brand opens her eyes, looks for Cooper. He is in the comm.
booth. He SHUTS the privacy curtain. She looks down.

INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Cooper studies the machine like it might bite him.
COOPER: Cooper.
COMPUTER VOICE: Messages span twenty-three years -
COOPER: I know.
(Whispers.)
Just start at the beginning.
Cooper leans forward as the screen flickers to life: Tom,
still seventeen, turns on the camera.
TOM: Hi, Dad -
Cooper pauses it. Prepares himself. Lets it run -
78.
TOM: I met another girl, Dad. I really
think this is the one -
Tom holds up a picture of himself and a teenage GIRL.
Murph stole Grandpa’s car. She
crashed it - she’s okay, though.
Your truck’s still running -
Grandpa said she should steal that
next time. I said if she did it’d
be the last thing she did ...
Cooper leans back ...

INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - DAY

Cooper is holed up, still watching, unshaved. He’s been
watching for days. On the screen, Tom is in his twenties -
TOM: I’ve got a surprise for you, Dad.
You’re a grandpa ...
Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling.
Congratulations. Meet Jesse.
Cooper smiles a tearful smile.
Grandpa said he already earned the
’great’ part so we just leave it at
that.
The screen cuts out. Then comes back on. Tom in his thirties
-
Hi, Dad. I’m sorry it’s been
awhile. What with Jesse and all ...
He stops, emotional.
Grandpa died last week. We buried
him out in the back forty, next to
Mom and Jesse.
(Looks down.)
Where we’d have buried you, if
you’d ever come back.
(Looks up.)
Murph was there for the funeral. I
don’t see her so much anymore.
(Sighs.)
You’re not listening to this. I
know that. All these messages are
just out there, drifting in the
darkness ... I figured as long as
they were willing to send them
there was some hope, but ...
79.
(Pauses.)
You’re gone. You’re never coming
back. And I’ve known that for a
long time. Lois says - that’s my
wife, Dad - she says I have to let
you go. So I am.
(Reaches up to turn off
camera.)
Wherever you are, I hope you’re at
peace. Goodbye, Dad.
The screen goes black. Tears are streaming down Cooper’s
face. He stares at the black screen, wiping his face. He
starts to get up - the screen flickers to life once more -
A beautiful WOMAN of about forty has turned on the camera -
she looks at us, unsure about this. Makes a start -
WOMAN: Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.
Cooper peers into the face, recognizing -
COOPER: (whispers)
Murph?
WOMAN (MURPH): I never made one of these when you
were still responding cos I was so
mad at you for leaving. When you
went quiet, it seemed like I should
just live with my decision. And I
have ...
(Looks around.)
But today’s my birthday. And it’s a
special one because you once told
me -
She stops, unable to speak for a second.
MURPH: You once told me that when you came
back we might be the same age ...
and today I’m the age you were when
you left ...
(Starts crying.)
So it’d be a real good time for you
to come back.
Murph reaches up, switches off the camera and we stay with
her in -
80.

INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM, NASA - DAY

Murph brings her hand down from the camera. Wipes her tears.
PROFESSOR BRAND: (O.S., softly)
I didn’t mean to intrude.
Murph turns to see Professor Brand, now ELDERLY, in a
WHEELCHAIR in the doorway.
PROFESSOR BRAND: I’ve never seen you in here before.
Murph rises -
MURPH: I’ve never been in here before.
Murph wheels Professor Brand out into the corridor.

INT. CURVING CORRIDOR, NASA - MOMENTS LATER

Murph pushes Professor Brand.
PROFESSOR BRAND: I talk to Amelia all the time. It
helps. I’m glad you’ve started -
MURPH: I haven’t. I just had something I
wanted to get out.

INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Professor Brand wheels behind his desk.
PROFESSOR BRAND: I know they’re still out there.
MURPH: I know.
PROFESSOR BRAND: There are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting
through.
MURPH: (smiles gently)
I know, Professor.
81.
PROFESSOR BRAND: I’m not sure which I’m more afraid
of ... they never come back, or
they come back to find we’ve
failed.
She watches his introspection. Brings him back with -
MURPH: Then let’s succeed.
PROFESSOR BRAND: (gestures at formula)
So, back from the fourth iteration,
let’s run it with a finite set.
Murph has picked up a notebook. Pauses.
MURPH: With respect, Professor. We’ve
tried that hundreds of times.
PROFESSOR BRAND: And it only has to work once,
Murph.
She shrugs. Starts to work.

INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - LATER

Murph and Professor Brand sit, eating sandwiches on a
walkway. WORKERS move about the CIRCULAR CHAMBER, building
more SIDEWAYS INFRASTRUCTURE. Professor Brand looks down,
proud.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Every rivet they drive in could
have been a bullet. We’ve done well
for the world, here. Whether or not
we crack the equation before I kick
-
MURPH: Don’t be morbid, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND: I’m not afraid of death, Murph. I’m
an old physicist - I’m afraid of
time.
82.

INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Murph stands before the algebra. She REALIZES something.
MURPH: Time ... you’re afraid of time ...
CONVINCED, she TURNS -
Professor, the equation ...?
He looks up.
For years we’ve tried to solve it
without changing the underlying
assumptions about time -
PROFESSOR BRAND: And?
MURPH: And that means each iteration
becomes an attempt to prove its own
proof - it’s recursive. Nonsensical
-
PROFESSOR BRAND: (sharp)
Are you calling my life’s work
’nonsense’, Murph?
MURPH: No, I’m saying you’ve been trying
to finish it with one arm - no,
with both arms tied behind your
back ...
Murph focuses on Professor Brand, suddenly WARY ...
... and I don’t understand why.
Professor Brand looks down. Starts wheeling his chair.
PROFESSOR BRAND: I’m an old man, Murph. Could we
pick this up some other time? I’d
like to go talk to my daughter.
Murph nods. Looking at the Professor. Confused.
PROFESSOR BRAND:
(V.O.): Stepping out into the universe, we
must first confront the reality
that nothing in our solar system
can help us ...
83.

INT. COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH, ENDURANCE - NIGHT

Brand watches her father on screen.
PROFESSOR BRAND:
(V.O.): ... then we must confront the
realities of interstellar travel.
We must venture far beyond the
reach of our own life spans. We
must think not as individuals, but
as a species ...

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY

Romilly, Brand, Cooper, Tars and Case sit in discussion.
COOPER: Tars kept the Endurance right where
we needed her, but it took years
longer than we anticipated ...
Cooper puts both planets on screen - Dr Mann’s ice world,
and Edmunds’ desert planet.
COOPER: We don’t have the fuel to visit
both prospects. We have to choose.
ROMILLY: How? They’re both promising.
Edmunds’ data was better, but Dr
Mann is the one still transmitting.
BRAND: We’ve got no reason to suppose
Edmunds’ results would have soured.
His world has key elements to
sustain human life -
COOPER: As does Dr Mann’s.
BRAND: Cooper, this is my field. And I
really believe Edmunds’ is the
better prospect.
COOPER: (challenging)
Why?
84.
BRAND: Gargantua, that’s why.
(Steps to board.)
Look at Miller’s world -
hydrocarbons, organics, yes. But no
life. Sterile. We’ll find the same
thing on Dr Mann’s.
ROMILLY: Because of the black hole?
BRAND: (nods)
Murphy’s Law - whatever can happen
will happen. Accident is the first
building block of evolution - but
when you’re orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen - it sucks in
asteroids and comets, random events
that would otherwise reach you. We
need to go to further afield.
COOPER: You once referred to Dr Mann as the
’best of us’.
BRAND: He’s remarkable. We’re only here
because of him.
COOPER: And he’s there on the ground
sending an unambiguous message that
we should go to that planet.
Brand is silent. Romilly looks from Brand to Cooper.
ROMILLY: Should we vote?
COOPER: If we’re going to vote, there’s
something you need to know. Brand?
She says nothing.
He has a right to know.
BRAND: That has nothing to do with it.
ROMILLY: What does?
85.
COOPER: She’s in love with Wolf Edmunds.
ROMILLY: (to Brand)
Is that true?
BRAND: Yes. And that makes me want to
follow my heart. But maybe we’ve
spent too long trying to figure all
this with theory -
COOPER: You’re a scientist, Brand -
BRAND: I am. So listen to me when I tell
you that love isn’t something we
invented - it’s observable,
powerful. Why shouldn’t it mean
something?
COOPER: It means social utility - child
rearing, social bonding -
BRAND: We love people who’ve died ...
where’s the social utility in that?
Maybe it means more - something we
can’t understand, yet. Maybe it’s
some evidence, some artifact of
higher dimensions that we can’t
consciously perceive. I’m drawn
across the universe to someone I
haven’t seen for a decade, who I
know is probably dead. Love is the
one thing we’re capable of
perceiving that transcends
dimensions of time and space. Maybe
we should trust that, even if we
can’t yet understand it.
Brand looks at Romilly, who can’t meet her eye.
BRAND: Cooper, yes - the tiniest
possibility of seeing Wolf again
excites me. But that doesn’t mean
I’m wrong.
Cooper thinks back to his conversation with Donald.
86.
COOPER: Honestly, Amelia ... it might.
Romilly looks at Brand. It’s clear she’s lost.
COOPER: Tars, set the course for Dr Mann.
Brand is starting to tear up. She turns away.

EXT. OUTER SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

The thrusters FIRE, pushing the Endurance out of its orbit
of Gargantua.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - LATER

Brand is checking her POPULATION BOMB. Cooper enters.
COOPER: Brand, I’m sorry.
BRAND: Why? You’re just being objective.
(Beat.)
Unless you’re punishing me for
screwing up on Miller’s planet.
COOPER: This wasn’t a personal decision for
me.
Brand turns from her equipment. Looks him in the eye.
BRAND: Well, if you’re wrong, you’ll have
a very personal decision to make.
(Off look.)
Your fuel calculations are based on
a return journey. Strike out on Dr
Mann’s planet, and we’ll have to
decide whether to return home, or
push on to Edmunds’ planet with
Plan B. Starting a colony could
save us from extinction.
She closes the population bomb.
You might have to decide between
seeing your children again ... and
the future of the human race.
(Smiles bitterly.)
(MORE): 87.
BRAND (cont’d)
I trust you’ll be as objective,
then.

EXT. OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS

The Endurance sinks past a GLORIOUS NEBULA whose GOLDEN
MISTS DISSOLVE TO ROILING BLACK CLOUDS and we are -

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

Murph stands with Tom, now late forties. Watching a field
BURN.:
TOM: We’ll lose about a third this
season. But next year ... I’m gonna
start working Nelson’s fields.
Should make it up.
MURPH: What happened to Nelson?
Tom glances at her. Don’t ask. Heads for the house.

INT./EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

Murph at family dinner with Tom, LOIS, and their
six-year-old son COOP.
LOIS: Will you stay the night? We left
your room like it was ...
Murph looks down, awkward ...
MURPH: No, I need to ...
Murph looks upstairs. At Lois.
Too many memories, Lois.
She nods. Coop helps Tom clear. As Coop takes Murph’s plate
he starts COUGHING. Looks up at her, sees her concern,
GRINS.:
COOP: The dust.
He and Tom head into the kitchen.
88.
MURPH: I have a friend who should look at
his lungs, Lois.
She nods, is about to speak. Tom sits back down.
Pull back to reveal the glowing windows against the
darkening plain, dust clouds rolling across the horizon ...

INT. CORRIDOR, NASA - NIGHT

Murph hurries down a corridor with a doctor, GETTY.
GETTY: He started asking for you after he
came to, but we couldn’t raise you
-

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NASA - MOMENTS LATER

Murph is at Professor Brand’s bedside. He is hooked up to
machines. Barely breathing.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Murph ... Murph ...
Murph takes his hand with gentle concern.
MURPH: I’m here, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND: I don’t have much life ...
(Breathes.)
I have to tell you ...
MURPH: Try to take it easy.
PROFESSOR BRAND: All these ... years. All these
people ... counted on me ...
MURPH: It’s okay, Professor.
PROFESSOR BRAND: I let you ... all you ... down.
89.
MURPH: No. I’ll finish what you started.
Professor Brand looks up into Murph’s eyes, tears welling.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Murph. Good, good Murph. Such faith
... all these years, I told you to
have faith ... to believe ...
MURPH: I do believe -
PROFESSOR BRAND: I needed you to believe your father
was coming back ...
MURPH: I do, Professor -
PROFESSOR BRAND: Forgive me, Murph ...
MURPH: There’s nothing to forgive.
PROFESSOR BRAND: I lied, Murph. I lied to you ...
Murph looks at Professor Brand, confused.
PROFESSOR BRAND: There’s no reason to come back ...
no way to help us ...
MURPH: But Plan A - all this - all these
people ... the equation!
But Professor Brand slowly shakes his head, tears rolling
down. As Murph tries to comprehend, he settles, DRIFTING.
MURPH: (whispers)
Did he know?
Nothing.
Did my dad know?!
Nothing.
Did he abandon me?!
90.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Do ... not ... go...
She leans in to hear.
PROFESSOR BRAND: Gentle ... into ... into ...
MURPH: NO! NO! Professor, stay! You can’t!
You can’t leave ...
Getty is at her shoulder.
MURPH: You can’t, you can’t, you ...
Getty puts his hand on her shoulder. She sits there. Stuck.
As Professor Brand goes still ...
MURPH:
(V.O.): Dr Brand, I’m sorry to tell you
that your father died today ...

INT. COMMUNICATION ROOM, NASA - DAY

Murph, controlled anger, sits in front of the camera.
MURPH: He had no pain and was ... at
peace. I’m sorry for your loss.
She reaches to switch off the camera. STOPS. Acid.
Did you know, Brand? Did he tell
you ...?

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - DAY

Murph’s voice rings through the empty ship. Only Case there
to register it.
MURPH:
(V.O.): Did you know that Plan A was a sham
...?! You left us here. To die.
Never coming back ...
Through the window we see the Ranger moving away, towards -
91.

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY

Cooper and Tars, Brand and Romilly. Cooper peers out,
concerned, studying a heads-up display of CLOUD DENSITY ...

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger cuts through one cloud, banks left and SCRAPES
AGAINST THE NEXT ’CLOUD’, PANELS TEARING FROM THE WING - THE
CLOUDS ARE ACTUALLY SOLID ICE FORMATIONS ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper banks away from the ICE, glancing out at the damage -

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger moves cautiously through the ’cloudscape’ like a
ship through an ice field ...

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Romilly and Brand put their helmets on. Tars indicates the
beacon’s position. Cooper looks, BANKS the Ranger.

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The Ranger’s gear lowers as it comes to rest, tentatively,
at the base of what looks like a large CUMULUS CLOUD.

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - LATER

Cooper leads them up the ICE CLOUD. From a distance, they
are walking on a cloud. Tars brings up the rear.
Cooper crests a ridge. SPOTS something. He starts down
towards a dirty orange dot in the cloudscape.
92.

EXT. DR MANN’S POD - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper is there. The others arrive at the large metal pod -
WEATHERED and DAMAGED over the years, half buried in ice.
Nearby, various WIRE MARKERS stick out of the ice. Tars
starts digging out the hatch.

INT. DR MANN’S POD - LATER

A CRACK of COLD LIGHT, as the outer hatch is wrenched open.
Cooper steps through the airlock, into a CRYPT-LIKE SPACE -
Cooper’s hand sweeps ice from the nameplate of a
cryo-chamber, ’DR MANN’.
Tars fires up the cryo-chamber. The ice starts to melt.
Cooper, helmet off, CRACKS the lid, pushes it back,
revealing a figure in a plastic shroud. Cooper rips the seal
...
Dr Mann’s eyes flicker open. He watches Cooper, breathing,
focusing - reaches up with TREMBLING hands - GRABS Cooper -
PULLS himself up, CHEEK AGAINST CHEEK - SOBBING - hands
desperately CARESSING Cooper’s face. Cooper holds him tight.
COOPER: (whispering)
It’s okay. It’s okay.

INT. SAME - LATER

Dr Mann sits, blanket over his shoulders, sipping from a
steaming cup. He looks at their faces, marveling.
DR MANN: (cracked, parched)
Pray you never learn just how good
it can be to see another face.
(Shaky sip.)
I hadn’t much hope to begin with.
After so much time, I had none. My
supplies were exhausted. The last
time I went to sleep, I set no
waking date.
(Looks at them all.)
You have literally raised me from
the dead.
93.
COOPER: (smiles)
Lazarus.
DR MANN: (nods)
And the others?
ROMILLY: I’m afraid you’re it, sir.
DR MANN: So far, surely?
COOPER: With our situation, there’s not
much hope of any other rescue.
This hits Dr Mann hard. He looks down at his tea.
BRAND: Dr Mann, tell us about your world.
DR MANN: (smiles gently)
My world. Yes. Our world, we hope.
Our world is cold, stark ...

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY

Dr Mann leads the others up to the summit of a cloud.
DR MANN:
(V.O.): But undeniably beautiful ...
From the top, they watch the planet’s pale sun setting.
DR MANN: The days are sixty-seven cold
hours, the nights are sixty-seven
far colder hours ...
They make their way back into the shelter.
DR MANN:
(V.O.): The gravity is a very pleasant 80
percent of Earth’s. Up here, where
I landed, the ’water’ is alkali and
the ’air’ has too much ammonia in
it to breathe for more than a few
minutes ...
94.
Brand checks readings on Dr Mann’s instruments.

INT. DR MANN’S POD - NIGHT

The crew are captivated by Dr Mann ...
DR MANN: But down at the surface, and there
is a surface ... the chlorine
dissipates and the ammonia gives
way to crystalline hydrocarbons and
breathable air. To organics.
Possibly even to life.
(Off looks.)
Yes. We may be sharing this world.
BRAND: (giddy)
These readings are from the
surface?
Brand is reviewing Dr Mann’s piles of data.
DR MANN: Over the years I’ve dropped various
probes.
COOPER: How far have you explored?
DR MANN: I’ve mounted several major
expeditions, but with oxygen in
limited supply, Kipp there had to
do most of the legwork.
Dr Mann indicates a DEFUNCT ARTICULATED MACHINE.
TARS: What’s wrong with him?
DR MANN: Degeneration. He misidentified the
first organics we found as ammonia
crystals. We struggled on for a
time, but ultimately, I
decommissioned him and used his
power source to keep the mission
going.
(Remembers, sadly.)
I thought I was alone before I shut
him down.
95.
TARS: Would you like me to look at him?
DR MANN: No, I think he needs a human touch.
Tars turns to Brand.
TARS: Dr Brand, Case is relaying a
message for you from the comm.
station.
She nods.
MURPH:
(V.O.): ... He had no pain and was ... at
peace.

INT. DR MANN’S POD - LATER

Brand watches Murph’s message on Tars’ data screen.
MURPH: I’m sorry for your loss.
Brand STARES. Cooper is there. Murph reaches up -
BRAND: (abstract)
Is that Murph?
Cooper nods.
She’s become a -
MURPH: (acid)
Did you know, Brand? Did he tell
you? That Plan A was a sham ...?!
Cooper looks at Brand, who is shocked.
You left us here to set up your
colony. Never coming back ...
Murph does not want to ask, tears are running down her
cheeks -
(Small.)
Did my father know? Dad ...?
Cooper stares. Murph’s eyes bore into his ...
Did you leave me here to die?
96.
The screen goes dark. Cooper stands there, SHOCKED.
BRAND: Cooper, my father devoted his whole
life to Plan A - I have no idea
what she means -
DR MANN:
(O.S.): I do.
They turn. Dr Mann looks at them with gentle calm.
COOPER: He never even hoped to get people
off the Earth.
DR MANN: No.
BRAND: But he’s been trying to solve the
gravity equation for forty years!
Dr Mann comes over, looks into Brand’s eyes.
DR MANN: Amelia, your father solved his
equation before I even left.
BRAND: Then why wouldn’t he use it?!
DR MANN: The equation couldn’t reconcile
relativity with quantum mechanics.
You need more -
COOPER: More what?!
DR MANN: More data. You need to see inside a
black hole. And the laws of nature
prohibit a naked singularity.
COOPER: (to Romilly)
Is that true?
ROMILLY: If a black hole is an oyster, the
singularity is the pearl inside.
(MORE): 97.
ROMILLY (cont’d)
Its gravity is so strong, it’s
always hidden in darkness, behind
the horizon. That’s why we call it
a black hole.
COOPER: If we could look beyond the horizon
-
DR MANN: Some things aren’t meant to be
known.
(To Brand.)
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from
extinction. Plan B. A colony.
BRAND: Why not tell people? Why keep
building that damn station?
DR MANN: He knew how much harder it would be
for people to come together and
save the species, instead of
themselves ...
(To Cooper, sympathetic.)
Or their children.
COOPER: Bullshit.
DR MANN: Would you have left if you hadn’t
believed you were trying to save
them? Evolution has yet to
transcend that simple barrier - we
can care deeply, selflessly for
people we know, but our empathy
rarely extends beyond our line of
sight.
BRAND: But the lie. A monstrous lie ...
DR MANN: Unforgivable. And he knew it. Your
father was prepared to destroy his
own humanity to save our species.
He made the ultimate sacrifice.
98.
COOPER: No. That’s being made by the people
of Earth who’ll die because, in his
arrogance, he declared their case
hopeless.
DR MANN: I’m sorry, Cooper. Their case is
hopeless. We are the future.
Cooper REELS. Brand puts her hand on his shoulder -
BRAND: Cooper, what can I do?
He turns to her. Looks her in the eyes.
COOPER: Let me go home.
And the sound of WIND in DRY CORNSTALKS takes us -

INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK ON DUSTY PLAIN - DAWN

Murph drives. Getty next to her. In the distance, several
fields BURN.
GETTY: Are you sure?
MURPH: His solution was correct. He’d had
it for years.
GETTY: It’s worthless?
MURPH: It’s half the answer.
GETTY: How do you find the other half?
Murph points at the sky.
MURPH: Out there? A black hole. Stuck here
on Earth? I’m not sure you can.
They pass vehicles PILED HIGH with belongings and people.
99.
GETTY: They just pack up and leave. What
are they hoping to find?
MURPH: Survival.
(Looks ahead.)
Dammit!
A DUST STORM SWAMPS the truck, killing visibility. Murph
pulls over. Kills the engine. The wind rocks the car.
GETTY: Don’t people have a right to know?
MURPH: Panic won’t help. We have to keep
working, same as ever.
GETTY: Isn’t that just what Professor
Brand ...?
MURPH: (sharp)
Brand gave up on us - I’m still
trying to solve this.
GETTY: So you have an idea?
MURPH: No. I have a ... feeling.
Getty looks at her as she STARES out at the dust.
INSERT CUT: MURPH (TEN), wet hair, towel around neck, turns
and STARES at a book on the floor -
MURPH:
(V.O.): I told you about my ghost ...
She stoops to pick up the toy next to it - a broken LUNAR
LANDER.: MURPH (FORTY) puts her hands on the glass, watching the sand
scrape the car’s window ...
MURPH: My dad thought I called it a ghost
because I was scared of it ...
100.
INSERT CUT: MURPH (TEN) counts the books and gaps.
MARVELING.:
MURPH:
(V.O.): But I was never scared of it ...
MURPH (TEN) takes out her notebook and starts drawing lines
to represent the books.
MURPH:
(V.O.): I called it a ghost because it felt
like ...
MURPH (FORTY) turns to Getty.
MURPH: Like a person. Trying to tell me
something ...
The storm is clearing. Murph starts the engine.
If there’s an answer here on Earth,
it’s back there, somehow. No one’s
coming to save us.
(Pulls out.)
I have to find it ...
Murph pulls past a pickup piled with worldly goods and
people. She makes eye contact with two filthy kids in the
back ...
And we’re running out of time.

EXT. RANGER, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAWN

Tars is up on the wing of the Ranger. Case pilots the LANDER
in to land near the Ranger.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper is sitting with his feet on the console.
CASE: (over radio)
What about auxiliary oxygen
scrubbers?
COOPER: They can stay. I’ll sleep most of
the journey.
(Wry.)
(MORE): 101.
COOPER (cont’d)
I saw it all on the way out here.
Romilly comes through the airlock. Removes his helmet.
ROMILLY: I have a suggestion for your return
journey.
COOPER: What?
ROMILLY: Have one last crack at the black
hole ...
Tars enters.
ROMILLY: Gargantua’s an older, spinning
black hole - what we call a gentle
singularity.
COOPER: Gentle?
ROMILLY: They’re hardly gentle, but their
tidal gravity is quick enough that
something crossing the horizon fast
might survive ... a probe, say.
COOPER: What happens to it after it
crosses?
ROMILLY: Beyond the horizon is a complete
mystery - who’s to say there isn’t
some way the probe can glimpse the
singularity and relay the quantum
data? If he’s equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse
- X-ray, visible light, radio -
TARS: Just when did this probe become a
’he’?
Romilly looks from Tars to Cooper, sheepish.
102.
ROMILLY: Tars is the obvious candidate. I’ve
already told him what to look for.
TARS: I’d need to take the old optical
transmitter from Kipp.
COOPER: (to Tars)
You’d do this for us?
TARS: Before you get teary, try to
remember that as a robot I have to
do anything you say, anyway.
COOPER: Your cue light’s broken.
TARS: I’m not joking.
Bing. The light flashes on.

EXT. RANGER, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY

Brand and Dr Mann approach Cooper and Romilly at the foot of
the ladder. Cooper addresses Brand -
COOPER: Ranger’s almost ready. Case is on
his way back down with another
load.
BRAND: I’ll start a final inventory.
ROMILLY: Dr Mann, I need Tars to remove and
adapt some components from Kipp.
Dr Mann considers this. Looks at Tars. At Romilly.
DR MANN: He musn’t disturb Kipp’s archival
functions.
ROMILLY: I’ll supervise.
Dr Mann considers this. Nods.
103.
COOPER: We need to pick out a site. You
don’t wanna move the module once we
land it.
DR MANN: I’ll show you the probe sites.
Cooper glances around at the winds picking up -
COOPER: Will conditions hold?
DR MANN: These squalls usually blow over.
You’ve got a long-range
transmitter?
Cooper reaches up to check a box plugged in at his neck.
COOPER: Good to go.
Dr Mann points at a nozzle on his elbow -
DR MANN: Charged?
Cooper checks, thumbs up. Dr Mann sets off, Cooper follows.

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - LATER

As Cooper follows Dr Mann down a ridge, they see the lander
fly over. Cooper waves, reaches up to his long-range
transmitter -
COOPER: A little caution, Case?
CASE: (over radio)
Safety first, Cooper.
Cooper follows Dr Mann down to the edge of the ice. They
peer down a fifty-foot drop.
DR MANN: Just take it gently -
He steps off, DROPPING - his ELBOW JETS FIRE, slowing his
descent in time for him to land with a THUD. Cooper follows.
They set out through a massive CANYON of ice ...
104.
DR MANN: Brand told me why you feel you have
to go back -
Cooper STOPS.
COOPER: If this excursion is about trying
to change my mind, let’s turn
around right now.
DR MANN: No. I understand your position.
He turns and starts walking. Cooper follows.
DR MANN: You have attachments. I’m not
supposed to, but even without
family, I can promise you that the
yearning to be with other people is
massively powerful. Our instincts,
our emotions, are at the
foundations of what makes us human.
They’re not to be taken lightly.
The wind WHIPS ice crystals between them ...

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY

Murph introduces Getty to Lois and Coop. Getty pulls out a
STETHOSCOPE and starts examining Coop, Murph slips upstairs

Romilly watches Tars crouch down beside Kipp and connect
Kipp to his own power. Kipp shows signs of life ...

EXT. ICE CANYON, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

Dr Mann waits for Cooper catch up. The WIND is picking up -
DR MANN: You know why we couldn’t just send
machines on these missions, Cooper?
COOPER: (breathless)
Frankly, no.
DR MANN: (pressing on)
A trip into the unknown requires
improvisation. Machines can’t
improvise well because you can’t
program a fear of death. The
survival instinct is our single
greatest source of inspiration.
Dr Mann pauses to take a breath. Turns to Cooper.
Take you - a father. With a
survival instinct that extends to
your kids ...
COOPER: That’s why I’m going home, hopeless
or not.
DR MANN: And what does research tell us is
the last thing you’ll see before
you die?
(Off look.)
Your children. At the very moment
of death, your mind pushes you a
little harder to survive. For them.
Dr Mann turns and starts walking out onto a massive ice
field.
106.

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY

Murph brings Coop downstairs. Getty is listening to Lois’
back. He looks up at Murph. GRAVE. Shakes his head ...
GETTY: They can’t stay here.
TOM:
(O.S.): Murph?
Murph turns to see Tom in the doorway.
What is this ...?

EXT. LANDER, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

Brand is counting flight cases when a WIND whips ice at her

INT. DR MANN’S POD - CONTINUOUS

Romilly takes his helmet off, PEERING over Tars’ shoulder at
Kipp’s data screen. Confused.
ROMILLY: I don’t understand.

EXT. ICE FIELD, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

Cooper and Dr Mann are like two ants on a sheet.
DR MANN: The first window’s up ahead -
Cooper peers ahead to an OPENING in the ice. Dr Mann stops
at the edge. Looks around the wind-blasted ice plane.
When I left Earth I felt fully
prepared to die. But I just never
faced the possibility that my
planet wouldn’t be the one. None of
this turned out the way it was
supposed to.
COOPER: Professor Brand would disagree.
Cooper peers over the edge at an enormous CREVASSE ...
Dr Mann RIPS COOPER’S LONG-RANGE TRANSMITTER FROM HIS NECK -
107.
Cooper TURNS to Dr Mann - who BLASTS him with his ELBOW JET.
He SLIPS backwards, but avoids going over the edge -
COOPER: What are you doing?!
Until Dr Mann KICKS him. Cooper hits his jets, pushing
himself onto a lower ledge of ice -

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY

Tom confronts Murph while Getty looks on -
MURPH: They can’t stay here, Tom!
GETTY: Not one more day -
Tom TURNS, PUNCHES Getty - who collapses.
LOIS: Tom?!
TOM: Coop, get your aunt’s things -
she’s done here.
MURPH: Tom, Dad didn’t raise you this dumb
-
TOM: Dad didn’t raise us, Grandpa did,
and he’s buried outside with Mom in
our ground. I’m not leaving them -
MURPH: You have to, Tom -
TOM: I’m a farmer, Murph! You don’t give
up on the Earth.
MURPH: No! But she gave up on you! And
she’s poisoning your family.
108.

EXT. DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY

Cooper SCRAMBLES to his knees. Dr Mann approaches -
DR MANN: I’m sorry - I can’t let you leave.
COOPER: Why?!
DR MANN: We’re going to need your ship to
continue the mission ... once the
others realize what this place
isn’t.
Cooper’s mind races. He looks around.
COOPER: You faked all the data?
DR MANN: I had a lot of time.
COOPER: Is there even a surface?
DR MANN: I’m afraid not -
Dr Mann KICKS Cooper over the edge, Cooper CLINGS on -
DR MANN: I tried to do my duty, Cooper, but
the day I arrived I could see this
place had nothing. I resisted the
temptation for years ... but I knew
there was a way to get rescued.
COOPER: You fucking coward.
Cooper BLASTS Dr Mann off his feet with his jet - SCRAMBLES
up onto the ice. Dr Mann TACKLES him, they go down,
WRESTLING. WIDER shows us two TINY FIGURES in a VAST
LANDSCAPE, deciding the future of humanity with a BRAWL ...
109.

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - DAY

Murph begs Tom -
MURPH: Please, come with us.
TOM: To live underground, praying Dad
comes back to save us all?
MURPH: He’s not coming back. He was never
coming back. It’s up to us. To me.
TOM: You’re gonna save the human race,
Murph? Really? How? Our dad
couldn’t -
MURPH: HE DIDN’T EVEN TRY!
(Off look.)
He just abandoned us, Tom.
Murph looks around, frustrated. Coop hands Murph the box.
MURPH: Tom, if you won’t come, let them -
TOM: Murph.
(Points at box.)
Take your stuff, and go. Murph
hands the box back to Coop.
MURPH: Keep it.
She leaves. Getty follows.

EXT. ICE FIELD, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY

Dr Mann LUNGES at Cooper, who SIDESTEPS him and PINS him ...
COOPER: Stop this!
Dr Mann HEADBUTTS COOPER, FACEPLATE IMPACTS FACEPLATE.
110.
COOPER: Mann! Don’t - you’ll kill us both -
CRACK. Dr Mann SMASHES his helmet into Cooper’s AGAIN AND
AGAIN as he -
DR MANN: SOMEONE’S - GLASS - WILL - GIVE -
WAY - FIRST -!
COOPER: FIFTY-FIFTY YOU KILL YOUR SELF!
STOP!: Dr Mann STOPS. Looks up at Cooper, BREATHING. Both
faceplates have TINY FRACTURES ...
DR MANN: Best odds I’ve had in years -
WHACK - He BUTTS Cooper’s faceplate, which CRACKS
SICKENINGLY. AMMONIA HISSES INSIDE - COOPER ROLLS OFF, HANDS
UP, DESPERATELY TRYING TO PLUG THE LARGE CRACK -
Dr Mann RISES. Checks the fractures in his own helmet. Bends
down to look at Cooper, STRUGGLING, CHOKING -
DR MANN: Please don’t judge me, Cooper - you
were never tested like I was. Few

GETTY: You did your best, Murph.
She just stares ahead at the road ...

EXT. ICE FIELD, DR MANN’S PLANET - DAY

With curiosity and FEAR, Dr Mann watches Cooper CRAWL ...
DR MANN: You’re feeling it, aren’t you? That
survival instinct - that’s what
drove me. It’s always driven the
human race, and it’s going to save
it now. I’m going to save it. For
all mankind. For you, Cooper.
111.
Unable to watch any more, he RISES, walking away, continuing
to talk to Cooper via the radio ...
DR MANN: I’m sorry, I can’t watch you go
through this - I thought I could.
But I’m still here. I’m here for
you ...
Dr Mann, hurrying away, listens to Cooper RASPING -
DR MANN: Cooper. When you left, did
Professor Brand read you that poem?
How does it end ...?
Dr Mann hauls himself up a ledge. The wind WHIPS up ice.
DR MANN: (over radio)
’Do not go gentle ...’
Cooper FREEZES. REMEMBERS. TRANSMITTER ...
DR MANN: (over radio)

Cooper LOOKS around - on the ice ten feet away - the

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper looks at Case -
COOPER: What happens if he blows the hatch?
CASE: Nothing good.
COOPER: Pull us back!
Case hits the retro-thrusters.

--PEAT - DO NOT OPEN INNER HATCH!
Dr Mann is STARTLED by the voice. He hits the transmitter -
DR MANN: Brand, I don’t know what Cooper’s
told you, but I’m taking control of
the Endurance, then we’ll talk
about continuing the mission. This
is not my survival, or Cooper’s -
this is mankind’s -
Turns back to the lever ... PULLS IT -
A DEVASTATING RUSH OF AIR YANKS HIM INTO THE AIRLOCK -
122.

EXT. ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

The ESCAPING AIR AND DEBRIS push Endurance into a slow SPIN

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER - CONTINUOUS

Dr Mann is HAMMERED by debris as the airlock starts to RIP
APART -:

Cooper checks the lander’s speed against Endurance - pulls
back on thrust as they come in below it -
124.

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The lander is PERILOUSLY CLOSE to the RED HOT UNDERSIDE of
the SPINNING ENDURANCE. The lander BANKS sideways, bringing
its airlock within FEET of the spinning Endurance -

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper looks sideways at the spinning hull -
COOPER: Case, you ready?
CASE: Ready.
Cooper watches the spinning hull, suddenly UNCERTAIN -
CASE: Cooper?
(Off look.)
This is no time for caution.
COOPER: (grins)
If I black out, take the stick -
Tars, get ready to engage the
docking mechanism - Brand, hold
tight -
CASE: Endurance is starting to heat -
COOPER:
HIT IT!: Case hits the RETRO-THRUSTERS. The view SPINS -

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The lander goes into a FASTER AND FASTER SPIN as it, with
Endurance, PLUMMETS towards the planet -

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

LIGHT FLASHES across their faces as the G-force of the spin
PULLS THEM AGAINST THEIR RESTRAINTS. Cooper STRUGGLES to
stay conscious - they BUFFET AGAINST THE ATMOSPHERE -
Tars opens the airlock - the Endurance hatch above him is
now SLOWLY ROTATING relative to him ...
125.

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The GLOWING HOT Endurance and the lander PLUMMET, SPINNING
towards the ice planet, whose curvature is FAST DISAPPEARING

INT. AIRLOCK, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Tars peers up as THE SPIN SPEEDS MATCH. He waits as the
BUFFETING moves the hatches ... THEY LINE UP - he FIRES the
GRAPPLES - they don’t connect - the hatches moved -

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Brand loses consciousness - Cooper watches the instruments,
not the dizzying view, on the point of RED OUT -
COOPER: Come on, Tars ... come on ...

INT. AIRLOCK, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Tars sees the hatches roll back into ALIGNMENT. He FIRES
AGAIN - this time THE GRAPPLES HOLD -
TARS:
GOT IT!:

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper registers this. Case fires the retro-rockets to slow
the spin.
COOPER: Gen-- gentle, Case ...

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

The two craft, NOW JOINED, start to spin more SLOWLY ...

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper eases back into his seat as the G-force lessens -
COOPER: Get ready to pull us up -
The spin is slowing to almost nothing -
126.

EXT. STRATOSPHERE, DR MANN’S PLANET - CONTINUOUS

Parts are RIPPING off the Endurance in the HEAT -

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper EASES into POWER on the main thrusters -
COOPER: Come on. You can do it ...

The THRUSTERS on the lander start to DRAG both ships back up
away from the planet, the heat DIMINISHING -

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Cooper pulls back on the sticks, RELIEF washing over him.
Brand comes to ... Cooper turns to Case, grinning -
COOPER: Right? And for our next trick ...
CASE: It’ll have to be good. We’re
heading into Gargantua’s pull -
Cooper’s smile fades. He UNBUCKLES -
COOPER: Take her -

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - MOMENTS LATER

HISSING STEAM - RUSHING AIR - WHIRLING DEBRIS as Tars and
Cooper (in suit and helmet) lock down different BULKHEADS -
Brand (in suit and helmet) FLOATS alongside the POPULATION
BOMB, checking the equipment -
CASE: (over radio)
Cooper, we’re slipping towards
Gargantua - shall I use main
engines?
127.
COOPER: No! Let her slide as long as we can
-
Cooper FLIES over to Tars, who is welding a bulkhead -
COOPER: Give it to me.
TARS: There’s good news and bad news -
COOPER: I’ve heard that one, Tars - just
give it to me straight.

INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

Cooper SCRAMBLES to where Brand is checking her equipment.
COOPER: The navigation mainframe’s
destroyed and we don’t have enough
life support to make it back to
Earth. But we might scrape to
Edmunds’ planet.
BRAND: What about fuel?
COOPER: Not enough. But I’ve got a plan -
let Gargantua suck us right to her
horizon - then a powered slingshot
around to launch us at Edmunds.
BRAND: Manually?
COOPER: That’s what I’m here for. I’ll take
us just inside the critical orbit.
BRAND: And the time slippage?
COOPER: Neither of us can afford to worry
about relativity right now.
128.
BRAND: I’m sorry, Cooper.
They embrace, delicately touching faceplate to faceplate.

Cooper looks ahead at Gargantua. Preparing for battle.

EXT. ENDURANCE - MOMENTS LATER

The lander DETACHES, shifting its orientation ...
COOPER: (over radio)
Once we’ve gathered enough speed
around Gargantua - we use the
lander 1 Ranger 2 as
rocket-boosters to push us out of
the black hole’s gravity ...
The lander REATTACHES to the rear of the ring module.

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER 2 - CONTINUOUS

Cooper slides into Ranger 2 - checking the systems.
COOPER: The linkages between landers are
destroyed ...

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Tars sits at the controls, running similar checks ...
COOPER: (over radio)
So we’ll control manually. When
Lander 1’s spent, Tars will detach
...
129.
TARS: And get sucked into that black
hole.

INT. RING MODULE, ENDURANCE - CONTINUOUS

Brand and Case listen to Cooper and Tars over the radio.
BRAND: Why does he have to detach?
COOPER: (over radio)
We have to shed mass if we’re gonna
escape that gravity.
TARS: (over radio)
Newton’s third law - the only way
humans have ever figured out of
getting somewhere is to leave
something behind.
BRAND: Cooper, you can’t ask Tars to do
this for us -

INT. COCKPIT, RANGER 2 - CONTINUOUS

Cooper puts his hands on the controls -
COOPER: He’s a robot, Amelia - I don’t have
to ask him to do anything.

INT. COCKPIT, LANDER - CONTINUOUS

Tars sits at the controls, ready.
TARS: It’s our last chance to save people
on Earth - if I can find some way
to transmit the quantum data I’ll
find in there, they might still
make it.

Brand considers this.
BRAND: If there’s someone still there to
receive it ...

EXT. GARGANTUA - DAY

A BLACK DOT appears, RUSHING TOWARDS US to become - A DARK
SPHERE - we PLUNGE through it into SILENT DARKNESS - a WHITE
SPHERE races towards us -
Just as the wormhole was a spherical hole, THESE SPHERES ARE
HOLES WITHIN HOLES ... we are dropping through A
FOUR-DIMENSIONAL RABBIT HOLE -
LIGHT/DARK/LIGHT/DARK/LIGHT/DARK with BLINDING RAPIDITY -

IMMINENT. INITIATE EJECTION.: Cooper is LAUNCHED out of Ranger 2, which EXPLODES, and,
PULLED to one side, MISSES A WHITE HOLE - PLUNGING INSTEAD
TOWARDS A SMALLER GLASS-LIKE SPHERE -
Cooper slows as he falls towards this sphere, reminiscent of
the wormhole, but the light within is not stars but an
infinity of WORLD LINES - (paths of objects through
spacetime) -
Cooper PLUNGES INTO THE WORLD SPHERE ... As he falls his
SINGLE WORLD LINE stretches behind him - the INFINITE
FUTURES OF HIS WORLD LINE splitting ahead to all the
different possibilities in spacetime -
Cooper himself is now like a ring being pulled down a cone
of fabric. He STARES at the ORDERED CHAOS of world lines ...
As he SLOWS his past and future world lines BREAK UP so they
become like INFINITE REFLECTIONS IN PARALLEL MIRRORS ...
Cooper’s world line DROPS into a SMALL, SQUARE TUNNEL -

Tight enough to feel BLINDINGLY FAST at first, but Cooper
(and his INFINITE OTHERS) is actually SLOWING ... Cooper
DESPERATELY reaches out, KNOCKING the sides of the tunnel,
TRYING to slow himself - GRAPPLING - KICKING ’BRICKS’ out of

the ’walls’. He finally STOPS. Looks around in the SUDDEN
CALM, FLOATING, catching his breath. He reaches out to the
tunnel wall - CONFUSED -
Each ’brick’ is TIGHTLY PACKED PAPER ... PAGES ... BOOKS -
AS SEEN FROM BEHIND A SHELF ...
Cooper PUSHES against a book - it MOVES SLIGHTLY. Cooper
PUSHES, HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER -
The book drops out of sight, revealing -

INT. THE TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper watches Murph (ten) examine the two pieces of the
LUNAR LANDER MODEL -
COOPER:
MURPH! MURPH!: She turns ... leaves the room ... Cooper floats there,
staring. He LOOKS around - each ’wall’ of the tesseract is a
different view of Murph’s bedroom, so that by rotating he
can effectively orbit her room ...
He claws his way down to the next book wall. PUNCHES out two
books -
Murph’s bedroom, empty. The door opens, Cooper’s EARLIER
SELF is standing there, staring at the room, perturbed.
Murph (ten) joins Cooper, staring at the empty room ...
Cooper LASHES out at the books - kicks a book out - SPOTS -
Murph (ten) closes her door, crying, sliding the desk in
front -

Cooper, the frustrated observer, spins around to see his
EARLIER SELF nudging the door -

fool.
Cooper PUNCHES OUT books with all his strength -
COOPER: S ... T ...
Murph (ten) is watching, no longer scared, fascinated -
COOPER: A ... Y ...
Cooper STOPS. Catches his breath. Waits ...
Earlier Cooper lifts the chair off the table to enter.
Cooper watches his earlier self, FRUSTRATED -
COOPER: Stay, you idiot! Tell him, Murph!
Stay ...
As before, Cooper gives Murph the WATCH ... Murph THROWS THE

His earlier self turns back. Looks at the book. Then leaves.
Cooper rests his head against the books, SOBBING.

Cooper, STARTLED, turns. Tars is not there.
COOPER: You survived.
TARS: (over radio)
Somewhere. In their fifth
dimension. They saved us ...
COOPER: (frustrated)
Who’s ’They’? And why would they
help us?
142.
TARS: (over radio)
I don’t know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space inside
their five-dimensional reality to
allow you to understand it ...
COOPER: It isn’t working -!
TARS: (over radio)
Yes, it is. You’ve seen that time
is represented here as a physical
dimension - you even worked out
that you can exert a force across
spacetime -
COOPER: (realizing)
Gravity. To send a message ...
Cooper looks around the infinite tunnel, infinite Coopers.
COOPER: Gravity crosses the dimensions -
including time -
Cooper THINKS ... He pulls himself up to a different wall,
starts counting books ...
And you have the quantum data, now
-
TARS: (over radio)
I’m transmitting it on all
wavelengths - but nothing’s getting
out ...
COOPER: I can do it -
Cooper HITS a book’s world line, sending a WAVE ...
TARS: (over radio)
Such complicated data ... to a

EXT. THE TESSERACT - DAY

Cooper watches Murph (ten) looking out the window ...
TARS: (over radio)
Even if you communicate it here,
she wouldn’t understand its
significance for years ...
Cooper is seized by a sudden anger -
COOPER: Then figure something out!
Everybody on Earth is going to die!
TARS: Cooper, they didn’t bring us here
to change the past.
Cooper hears something in this -
COOPER: We brought ourselves here ...
Cooper PUSHES off, looking through the gaps in the books.
Murph’s bedroom, full of DUST in the DUST STORM -
COOPER: Tars, feed me the coordinates of
NASA in binary ...
Cooper is in the room now, drawing a pattern in the dust ...
Cooper watches Murph (ten) burst into the room. Murph stops
and stares at the dust as Cooper’s Earlier Self comes in
past her, SLAMS the window shut - sees the PATTERN of dust
...
144.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT

Murph (forty) runs her finger along the DUST of the
windowsill ... She turns to look around the room.
Frustrated.
MURPH: Come on, Dad. Is there something
else here ...?

INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper looks up from the floor -
COOPER: Don’t you see, Tars? I brought
myself here. We’re here to
communicate with the
three-dimensional world. We’re the

Cooper moves to another iteration of Murph’s room. Murph
(ten) JUMPS up - GRABS the WATCH, RUNS out the door ...

Murph (forty) looks at the watch, remembering. The second
hand TWITCHES. She drops the watch back into the box ...

INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper pushes himself along the world line of the books ...
COOPER: I thought they chose me - they
never chose me - they chose Murph.

For what?
COOPER: To save the world!
Murph (ten) comes back into her bedroom, SOBBING. She is
holding the watch. She puts it on the shelf.

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT

Murph (forty) puts the box back on the shelf. SIGHS ...

INT. TESSERACT - CONTINUOUS

Cooper races FASTER and FASTER down the world lines.
COOPER: ’They’ have access to infinite
time, infinite space ...
Cooper gestures at the INFINITIES in all directions ...
COOPER: But no way to find what they need -
but I can find Murph and find a way
to tell her - like I found this
moment -
TARS: (over radio)
How?
COOPER: Love, Tars. Love - just like Brand
said - that’s how we find things
here.
TARS: (over radio)
So what are we here to do?
Cooper looks around the tesseract. The watch sits there on
the shelf for as long as he can see ...
COOPER: The watch. That’s it. She’ll come
back for it -
TARS: How do you know?
COOPER: Because I gave it to her. We use
the second hand. Translate the data
into Morse and feed it to me -
Tars starts to transmit. Cooper GRABS the second-hand world
line - starts to MANIPULATE it, sending waves down the world
line ...
146.
TARS: What if she never came back for it?
COOPER: She will. She will ... I feel it
...
The second hand is FLICKING back and forth ...

INT. MURPH’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT

Murph (forty) turns to leave ...
GETTY:
(O.S.):
MURPH, HE’S COMING!: She pauses. Goes back to the box - reaches in. PULLS OUT THE
WATCH ... staring at it ... wondering ...
GETTY:
(O.S.):
MURPH?! MURPH ...?!:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - TWILIGHT

Getty is holding a tire iron, watching TOM’S TRUCK APPROACH.
Lois and Coop STARE, FEARFUL, from the truck ...
Tom APPROACHES, BLACK from soot ...
Murph BURSTS out of the house ... right up to Tom ...
MURPH: Tom, he came back ... he came back
...
TOM: Who?
She holds up the watch ...
MURPH: Dad. It was him. All this time ...
it was him. He’s going to save us
...
CLOSE ON the second hand of the watch, FLICKING back and
forth -
147.

INT. PROFESSOR BRAND’S OFFICE - DAY

Murph furiously TRANSCRIBES the movements of the second hand
-

INT. CORRIDOR, NASA - LATER

Murph, papers in hand, RUNS down the corridor, BUMPS into
Getty - doesn’t stop ...

INT. LAUNCH FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

Murph runs to the railing of the catwalk above the enormous
construction, looks down at the thousands of workers below.
Getty comes out after her, curious. She looks at him, then
SHOUTS OUT to the enormous space ...
MURPH:
EU-RE-KA!: She turns to Getty - GRINNING.
Well, it’s traditional.
She THROWS her paper out over the railing -
EUREKA!!: Workers look up to see her papers flitting down ...

EXT. THE TESSERACT - DAY

Cooper looks out at the world line of the watch, of Murph,
as it leads out into infinite complexity ...
COOPER: Did it work?
TARS: (over radio)
I think it might have.
COOPER: (hopeful)
Why?
TARS: (over radio)
Because the bulk beings are closing
the tesseract ...
148.
Cooper looks out to the distance - it is RAPIDLY
APPROACHING, WORLD LINES BECOMING WORLD SHEETS, BECOMING
BULKS ...:
COOPER: Don’t you get it, yet, Tars? ’They’
aren’t ’beings’ ... they’re us ...
trying to help ... just like I
tried to help Murph ...
TARS: (over radio)
People didn’t build this tesseract
-
COOPER: Not yet ... but one day. Not you
and me but people, people who’ve
evolved beyond the four dimensions
we know ...
The tesseract EXPANSION BACK INTO FIVE DIMENSIONS IS ALMOST
UPON THEM - Cooper BRACES HIMSELF -
COOPER: What happens now -?
BAM - he is swept up in the expansion like a tiny leaf on a
CHURNING WAVE -: Cooper FLIES through the EXPANDING COSMOS, past PLANETS
ORBITING STARS, WHICH BECOME ATOMIC PARTICLES, WHICH BECOME
MATTER, BECOMING STARS ...
Cooper APPROACHES A GLASSY TUBE. Inside is the OLD,
UNDAMAGED ENDURANCE. As Cooper looks in from the bulk he
sees: Brand, strapped in, Doyle opposite, traversing the
wormhole for the first time ...
Cooper REACHES for Brand ... She sees something, reaches up
- their hands would touch if they weren’t in different
dimensions, her fingers distorting the space of his fingers
-
WHAM! She, and the Endurance, are SWEPT PAST - Cooper is
SMASHED into the spacetime of the wormhole - he SCREAMS AND
WE -: 149.

INT. OUTER SPACE - LATER

Cooper FLOATS, dead or unconscious, near Saturn. In the
distance we see two Rangers approaching ...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Cooper’s eyes flicker open. A bright room with an open
window, net curtains obscuring the view. We hear the CRACK
of a baseball off a bat. Children LAUGHING.
VOICE:
(O.S.): Mr Cooper? Mr Cooper?
Cooper looks over to see a Nurse and a Doctor watching him.
He tries to sit up.
DOCTOR: Take it slow, sir. Remember you’re
no spring chicken any more.
(Amused.)
I gather you’re one hundred and
twenty-four years old.
(Checks Cooper’s chart.)
You were extremely lucky. The
Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply -
COOPER: Where am I?
The Doctor, almost surprised, TURNS, moves to the window,
opens the curtains. Where Cooper should see sky, he sees a
CURVING UPSIDE-DOWN TOWN ...
DOCTOR: Cooper Station. Currently orbiting
Saturn.
The Nurse helps Cooper to the window. He looks out at the
VAST CYLINDRICAL STATION - cornfields and buildings. Outside
his window, kids are playing baseball. The batter hits a POP
FLY ... the kids watch it up and up, until it carries on,
falling up towards the buildings above. The kids SHOUT a
warning - the ball smashes a skylight. Cooper watches the
kids laugh.
COOPER: Nice of you to name the place after
me.
The Nurse giggles. The Doctor shoots her a look -
150.
What?
DOCTOR: The station wasn’t named after you,
sir ... It was named after your
daughter.
Cooper smiles at this ...
DOCTOR: Although, she’s always maintained
just how important you were -
COOPER: Is she ...
(Braces.)
still alive?
DOCTOR: She’ll be here in a couple weeks.
She’s really far too old for a
transfer from another station, but
when she heard you’d been found ...
well, this is Murphy Cooper we’re
talking about.
COOPER: (marveling)
Yes, it is ...
The Doctor is wrapping up -
DOCTOR: We’ll have you checked out in a
couple days.
Cooper turns back to the window, thinking ...
ADMINISTRATOR:
(V.O.): I’m sure you’ll be excited to see
what’s in store ...

INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - DAY

The ADMINISTRATOR, thirties, leads Cooper along a walkway -
ADMINISTRATOR: We’ve got a nice situation for you
...
151.
Cooper looks down at a line of SLEEK NEXT-GENERATION
RANGERS. Sees a PILOT climb into one. Mechanics work another
...
ADMINISTRATOR: I actually did a paper on you in
high school, sir. I know all about
your life on Earth ...

EXT. TOWN SQUARE, COOPER STATION - CONTINUOUS

Cooper looks at the strangely ordinary town the
Administrator is walking him through ...
ADMINISTRATOR: So when I made my suggestion to Ms
Cooper, I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect ...

EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The Adminstrator leads Cooper through a cornfield ... The
old farmhouse is there, preserved. As Cooper approaches, a
small monitor starts playing the footage of OLD-TIMERS from
the start of the movie.
ADMINISTRATOR: Of course, I didn’t speak to her
personally ...
As Cooper passes the monitor it changes to a FAMILIAR OLD
LADY, but Cooper misses it ...

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

OLD-TIMERS play on video screens: a museum exhibit. The
Administrator holds the door open for Cooper.
ADMINISTRATOR: But she confirmed just how much you
loved farming.
COOPER: She did, huh?
Cooper looks over the kitchen. Cooper sees a
familiar-looking articulated machine -
152.
COOPER: Is that ...?
ADMINISTRATOR: The machine we found out near
Saturn when we found you, yes. Its
power source was shot, but we could
get you another if you want to try
and get it up and running again.
Cooper turns to the Administrator.
COOPER: Please.

INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - EVENING

Cooper, from the catwalk, watches the last of the Rangers
come back from patrol. The PILOT jumps down as the ground
crew wheels it into its place in the line of sleek ships.

INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Cooper has Tars’ head laid out on the kitchen table.
TARS: Settings: general settings,
security setting -
COOPER: Honesty. New level setting.
Ninety-five percent.
TARS: Confirmed. Additional
customization?
COOPER: Yes. Humor, seventy-five percent.
Wait.
(Thinks.)
Sixty percent.

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

Cooper enters, nervous. A nurse is there.
COOPER: Is she -?
153.
NURSE: The family’s all in there.
COOPER: The family?
NURSE: They all came along to see her -
she’s been in cryo-sleep for almost
two years.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cooper cautiously pushes open the door. The bed is
surrounded by people, grown-up children, grandchildren,
babies ... They turn to look at him: some SMILES, some
CURIOUS looks, a small child HIDES behind a parent’s leg ...
Cooper approaches, and the family parts to let him see an
ELDERLY WOMAN, lying in the bed, FRAIL.
She looks up at Cooper. Delighted. Tears of joy. She reaches
up to him ... he takes her hands.
COOPER: Murph.
MURPH: Dad.
(To the others.)
Please.
Her voice is a frail whisper. With authority. The family
shuffles out. Cooper watches them go, turns back to Murph.
COOPER: You told them I like farming.
Murph smiles, still mischievous. Cooper marvels at her.
COOPER: Murph, it was me. I was your ghost.
MURPH: I know ...
She lifts her wrist - the WATCH is there ...
MURPH: People didn’t believe me, they
thought I’d done it all myself ...
(Taps watch.)
(MORE): 154.
MURPH (cont’d)
But I knew who it was ...
COOPER: A father looks in his child’s eyes
and thinks - maybe it’s them -
maybe my child will save the world.
MURPH: And everyone, once a child, wants
to looks into their own dad’s eyes
and know he saw. But, usually, by
then, the father is gone. Nobody
believed me, but I knew you’d come
back.
COOPER: How?
MURPH: Because my dad promised me.
Cooper is crying now.
COOPER: I’m here now. I’m here for you,
Murph.
Murph is shaking her head.
MURPH: No parent should have to watch
their child die. My kids are here
for me now. Go.
COOPER: Where?
MURPH: (it’s so obvious)
Brand.
And the family comes back in as Cooper releases Murph’s
hand, stepping back to let Murph’s kids and grandkids swarm
over her ... He watches them, their love, as if from another
dimension. A man out of time. A ghost.
MURPH:
(V.O.): She’s out there ...
155.

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY

Brand, in suit and helmet, stands watching Case excavate a
pod, buried under a massive rock fall. She is crying.
MURPH:
(V.O.): Setting up camp ...

EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT

MECHANIC finishes looking over one of the sleek new Rangers.
He packs his tools and heads out.
A figure unfolds itself in the shadows - Tars. He picks his
way through the shadows, unlocks the door. Cooper DARTS in
...

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY

Brand kneels in front of a small CROSS. Edmunds’ nameplate
hangs from it.
MURPH: ... Alone in a strange galaxy ...
She unseals her helmet - PULLS IT OFF ...

INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT

Cooper and Tars scurry down the line of sleek ships. Cooper
points - Tars starts working the hatch mechanism, while
Cooper KEEPS WATCH ...

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DAY

Brand, helmet off, BREATHES. And breathes again.
MURPH:
(V.O.): Maybe, right now, she’s settling in
for the long nap ...
156.

INT. RANGER IN HANGAR, COOPER STATION - NIGHT

Cooper STRAPS into the pilot’s chair, Tars beside him. The
outer doors slide open. They look out at the inky blackness
of space ...

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DUSK

Brand looks at the setting sun ...
MURPH:
(V.O.): By the light of our new sun ...

INT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION - MORNING

The Mechanic opening up, walks along the row of ships until
-
One is MISSING.

EXT. EDMUNDS’ DESERT PLANET - DUSK

Brand turns from the dwindling light ...
MURPH:
(V.O.): In our new home.
She heads down through the twilight towards camp. And we -
Fade out.
Credits.
End.

A VAST SPHERE OF FIRE, the fire of a thousand suns, slowly

And the sound of DOZENS OF FEET STAMPING RHYTHMICALLY...
FOR THIS HE WAS CHAINED TO A ROCK AND TORTURED FOR ETERNITY.
ROILING PLASMA expands, the sound of STAMPING GROWS
OPPRESSIVE, the STAMPING FASTER and FASTER OVER-
A FACE. Gaunt, tense, EYES TIGHTLY SHUT. The face SHUDDERS-
the sound CEASES AS MY EYES OPEN, STARING INTO THE CAMERA: Peer into my soul- J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, aged fifty, close-
cropped greying hair. The gentle sounds of bureaucracy...
SUPER TITLE: "1. FISSION"
VOICE (O.S.): Dr Oppenheimer, as we begin, I
believe you have a statement to
read into the record?
I glance down at my notes.
OPPENHEIMER: Yes, your honour-
SECOND VOICE (O.S.): We’re not judges, doctor.
OPPENHEIMER: No. Of course.
(I start reading)
Members of the Security Board, the
so-called derogatory information in
your indictment of me cannot be

CLOSE: on a prosperous sixty-three-year-old man, LEWIS
STRAUSS, as he takes a cup of coffee from a SENATE AIDE...
SUPER TITLE: "2. FUSION"
STRAUSS: I forget. Three days, or so. The
whole hearing took a month.
SENATE AIDE: An ordeal.
STRAUSS: I’ve only read the transcripts, but
who’d want to justify their whole
life?
SENATE AIDE: You weren’t there?
STRAUSS: As Chairman, I wasn’t allowed to
be. Are they really going to ask
about it? It was years ago.
SENATE AIDE: Four years ago. Oppenheimer still
divides America- the committee will
want to know where you stood.
(checks his watch)
Ready?

INT. CORRIDOR, SENATE BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER (B&W)

The Senate Aide leads Strauss along the corridor.
SENATE AIDE: Senator Thurmond asked me to say
not to feel you’re on trial.
STRAUSS: I didn’t, till you said that.

SENATE AIDE: When they bring up Oppenheimer,
answer honestly and no senator can
deny that you did your duty. It’ll
be uncomfortable...
(smiles)
Who’d want to justify their whole

The door to the VAST committee room opens- they enter,
FLASHBULBS POPPING as PRESS and PUBLIC see Strauss.
ROBB (V.O.): Why did you leave the United
States?

INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY (COLOUR)

The room is SMALL, SHABBY. Surprised, I look up from my
statement at the prosecutor, Roger ROBB. Then turn to the
THREE BOARD MEMBERS (GRAY, EVANS, MORGAN).
OPPENHEIMER: I wanted to learn the new physics.
GRAY: Was there nowhere here? I thought
Berkeley had the leading
theoretical physics department-
OPPENHEIMER: Sure. Once I built it. First I had
to go to Europe. I went to
Cambridge to work under Patrick
Blackett.
ROBB: Were you happier there than in
America?

a hidden universe...

INT. LABORATORY, CAMBRIDGE -- DAY

The young ME, frazzled demeanor, STRUGGLES with equipment.
OPPENHEIMER (V.O.): ...useless in the lab.
I drop a beaker, it SHATTERS. PATRICK BLACKETT looks over,
FROWNING. He picks up an APPLE and takes a LARGE BITE.
BLACKETT: (through apple)
Christ, Oppenheimer, have you had
any sleep? Start again.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: I need to go to the lecture.
BLACKETT: Why?
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: (pleading)
It’s Niels Bohr.
Blackett checks his watch- starts packing up-
BLACKETT: Damn, completely forgot. Let’s go.
I start to pack up with the other students.
BLACKETT (CONT’D): Not you. Finish coating those
plates.
I clean up as Blackett and the other students leave- one
leaves an APPLE for Blackett- GREEN WITH STEM AND TINY LEAF.
I pause at a bottle: "Potassium Cyanide"... CLUMSY HANDS
SHAKING, I draw CYANIDE into a syringe. I INJECT the apple...

INT. LECTURE HALL, CAMBRIDGE -- CONTINUOUS

I sneak into the back of the auditorium. Standing,
SPELLBOUND, as NIELS BOHR, a charismatic Dane, lectures.
BOHR: ...It’s a new way to understand
reality. Einstein’s opened a door,
now we’re peering through, seeing a
world inside our world... a world
of energy and paradox that not
everyone can accept.
I RAISE my hand to ask a question...

STRAUSS: Correct.
SENATOR MCGEE: You were a commissioner of the
Atomic Energy Commission?
STRAUSS: I was, but I met Robert in my

Strauss, younger, fifty-one, bustles out of the Institute-
STRAUSS (V.O.): ...I was determined to get him to
run the Institute.
-to welcome the rail-thin figure of Oppenheimer (forty-
three), emerging from a TAXI in HAT and coat, PIPE in mouth.
ICONIC.:
STRAUSS: Dr Oppenheimer, an honour.
OPPENHEIMER: Mr Strauss.
STRAUSS: It’s pronounced 'straws'.
OPPENHEIMER: 'Oh-ppenheimer', 'aw-ppenheimer'-
any way you say it they know I’m
Jewish.
STRAUSS: I’m a proud member of Temple
Emmanuel- 'straws' is the Southern
pronunciation. Welcome to the
Institute. I think you could be
very happy here.
OPPENHEIMER: Oh?
STRAUSS: Well, you’ll love the commute- the
position comes with that house for
you and your wife.
Strauss points along an avenue of trees to Olden Manor...
STRAUSS (CONT’D): And your two children...
Oppenheimer nods as he follows Strauss into the Institute.

OPPENHEIMER: I can relate to that...
STRAUSS: Really?
OPPENHEIMER: (dry)
My father was one.

INT. PRESIDENT’S OFFICE, INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY --

MOMENTS LATER (B&W): Strauss shows Oppenheimer into the well-appointed office.
STRAUSS: This would be your office.
Oppenheimer drifts to the windows- a LAWN rolls down to a
POND. He spots a FIGURE- long grey hair poking from under his
hat-
STRAUSS (CONT’D): I’m told he’s there most
afternoons.
The figure gently tosses a stone into the water.
STRAUSS (CONT’D): I’ve always wondered why you didn’t
involved him in the Manhattan
Project.
Oppenheimer turns to Strauss, interested.
STRAUSS (CONT’D): The greatest scientific mind of our
time?

8.
OPPENHEIMER: Of his time. Einstein published his
Theory of Relativity more than
forty years ago, but never embraced
the quantum world it revealed.
STRAUSS: 'God doesn’t play dice.'
OPPENHEIMER: Precisely. You never thought of
studying physics formally?
STRAUSS: I had offers. But I chose to sell
shoes.
OPPENHEIMER: Lewis Strauss was once a lowly shoe
salesman?
STRAUSS: No. Just a shoe salesman.
(opens the door)
I’ll introduce you-
OPPENHEIMER: No need. I’ve known him for years.
Strauss, awkward, stays in the doorway and WATCHES...

I RUN, DESPERATE, AGAINST the crowd-

INT. LABORATORY, CAMBRIDGE -- DAY

I BURST in- Blackett LOOKS UP. ANOTHER MAN has his back to
me. Between them on the workbench- the POISONED APPLE...
BLACKETT: You alright?
I nod awkward, trying to control my BREATHING...
BLACKETT (CONT’D): Niels, meet J. Robert Oppenheimer.
The other man TURNS, offers his hand- Niels Bohr.
BOHR: What does the 'J' stand for?
BLACKETT: Nothing, apparently.
Bohr takes me in- this strange, BREATHLESS young man...

9.

10.
BOHR: You were at my lecture. You asked
the only good question.
BLACKETT: Nobody’s denying his insight. It’s
his labouratory skills that leave a
little to be desired.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: I heard you give the same
lecture-
BOHR: At Harvard. And you asked the
same question. Why ask again?
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): I hadn’t liked your answer.
BOHR: Did you like it better yesterday?
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: A lot.
BOHR: You can lift the rock without being
ready for the snake that’s
revealed. Now, it seems, you’re
ready.
Bohr picks up the POISONED APPLE from Blackett’s desk...
BOHR (CONT’D): You don’t enjoy the lab?
I shake my head. Bohr GESTICULATES with the apple as he talks-
I watch it bob around- a kitten following a ball of string...
BOHR (CONT’D): Get out of Cambridge, with its
beakers and potions. Go somewhere
they’ll let you think...
(assesses me)
Gottingen.
BLACKETT: Born?
BOHR: Born. Get to Germany. Study under
Max Born. Learn the ways of theory.
I’ll send word.
Bohr raises the apple to take a bite- I GRAB it.

YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: Wormhole.

BOHR: How’s your mathematics?
BLACKETT: Not good enough for the physicist
he wants to be.
BOHR: Algebra’s like sheet music. The
important thing isn’t can you read
music, it’s can you hear it. Can
you hear the music, Robert?
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: I can.
SPARKS explode in WAVES, WAVES of FIRE CRASHING on a SHORE of
GLASS, FLYING OVER the MEDIEVAL SPIRES of Gottingen, I watch
BORN and BOHR and DIRAC, GALAXIES of PARTICLES DISPERSE and
REFORM, a CUBIST PAINTING transfixes the Young Me, an
ORCHESTRA plays STRAVINSKY, I read THE WASTE LAND, I WRITE
FURIOUSLY at a desk, I WRITE FURIOUSLY on a chalkboard, I
SMASH a glass, and ANOTHER, and ANOTHER, WATCHING the SHARDS
skid across the floor, CATCHING and REFRACTING LIGHT, I watch
RAINDROPS scintillate a PUDDLE, STREAM down a windowpane, I

STRAUSS: (friendly)
Albert...
Einstein PASSES without acknowledging Strauss. Strauss
reaches Oppenheimer-
STRAUSS (CONT’D): What did you say to him?

OPPENHEIMER: He’s fine. Mr Strauss, there are
things in my past you need to be
aware of.
STRAUSS: As Chairman of the AEC I have
access to your security file. I’ve
read it. The job is yours.
OPPENHEIMER: You’re not worried?
STRAUSS: After all you’ve done for your
country?
OPPENHEIMER: Times change, Mr Strauss.
STRAUSS: The purpose of this Institute is to
provide a haven for independent
minds. You’re the man for the job.
OPPENHEIMER: Then I’ll consider it. And I’ll see
you at the AEC meeting tomorrow.
Oppenheimer turns, heads back up the hill.
STRAUSS: (taken aback)
This is one of the most prestigious
appointments in the country...
Oppenheimer looks back at Strauss, GRINS-
OPPENHEIMER: With a great commute. That’s why
I’m considering it.
Strauss watches him go, shaking his head.

OPPENHEIMER (V.O.): ...where I first met Isidor Rabi...
A stocky young man, ISIDOR RABI (thirty), plonks down next to
a DUTCH STUDENT who reluctantly shifts, giving him room.
RABI: A Yank lecturing on new physics?
This I have to hear- I’m an

Rabi starts peeling his orange.
RABI: I caught your lecture on molecules.
Caught some if it- we’re a couple

I got here this semester.
Rabi STOPS peeling his orange to STARE at me-
RABI: You learned Dutch in six weeks to
give a lecture on quantum
mechanics?
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: I wanted to challenge myself.
RABI: Quantum physics isn’t challenging
enough? Schvitzer.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: Schvitzer?
RABI: 'Show-off.' Dutch in six weeks but
you never learned Yiddish?

14.

15.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: (smile)
They don’t speak it so much my side
of the park.
RABI: Screw you. Homesick?
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: You know it.
Rabi peels his orange. He turns serious...
RABI: Ever get the feeling our kind isn’t
entirely welcome here?
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: Physicists?
RABI: Funny.
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: Sometimes. Not in the department.
RABI: They’re all Jewish, too.
Rabi tosses me a slice of orange.
RABI (CONT’D): Eat.
I take the orange, 'sipping' at it.
RABI (CONT’D): In Zurich there’s a German you have
to seek out-
YOUNG OPPENHEIMER: Heisenberg.

INT. LECTURE HALL, ZURICH -- DAY

A tall man of twenty-six turns from the blackboard-
HEISENBERG. I study his every move. Rabi NUDGES me 'See?'...

INT. SAME -- LATER

Rabi introduces me to Heisenberg.

15.

16.
HEISENBERG: Oppenheimer, yes. I liked your
paper on molecules.
OPPENHEIMER: Probably because you inspired it.
HEISENBERG: If I inspire anything else, let me
know. We could publish together.
OPPENHEIMER: I have to get back to America.
HEISENBERG: Why? There’s no one there taking
quantum mechanics seriously.
OPPENHEIMER: That’s exactly why.
RABI: He’s pining for the canyons of
Manhattan.
OPPENHEIMER: The canyons of New Mexico.
HEISENBERG: You’re from New Mexico?
OPPENHEIMER: New York, but my brother and I have
a ranch outside of Santa Fe. That’s
the America I miss right now.
HEISENBERG: Then you best go home, cowboys.
RABI: That’s his thing- me and horses? I
don’t think so.
GRAY (V.O.): Did you ever encounter Heisenberg
again?

INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY

I smile to myself.

16.

17.
OPPENHEIMER: Not in person. But you might say
our paths crossed.
ROBB: Doctor, during your time in Europe,
you seem to have met a wide range
of other countries’ physicists...
(consulting notes)
Born, Bohr, Pauli, Dirac, Einstein,
Heisenberg...?
OPPENHEIMER: That’s right.
Robb looks up at me...
ROBB: Any Russians?
OPPENHEIMER: Not that spring to mind.
(from notes)
Returning to America I accepted
appointments at both Caltech...

EXT. BERKELEY -- DAY

I walk across campus to the physics department...
OPPENHEIMER (V.O.): ...and up at Berkeley.

INT. CORRIDOR, BERKELEY -- CONTINUOUS

I struggle to unlock a door... it opens-

INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- CONTINUOUS

A DUSTY storage space. Scattered tables and chairs. A piano.

EXT. CORRIDOR, BERKELEY -- MOMENTS LATER

I step out of the classroom. Look NEXT DOOR...

17.

18.

INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- DAY

I enter. A handsome young scientist, ERNEST LAWRENCE, works
on an assemblage of curved pipes and wiring with students,
including Luis ALVAREZ.
OPPENHEIMER: Dr. Lawrence, I presume.
LAWRENCE: You must be Oppenheimer. I hear you
want to start a school of quantum
theory.
OPPENHEIMER: I am starting it. Next door.
LAWRENCE: They put you in there?
OPPENHEIMER: I asked for it. I wanted to be
close to you experimentalists.
LAWRENCE: Theory will get you only so far.
(gestures)
We’re building a machine to
accelerate electrons.
OPPENHEIMER: Magnificent.
LAWRENCE: Would you like to help?
OPPENHEIMER: Build it? No. But I’m working on
theories I’d like to test with it.
LAWRENCE: When do you start teaching?
OPPENHEIMER: I’ve got my first in an hour.
LAWRENCE: Seminar?
OPPENHEIMER: Pupil.
LAWRENCE: One student? That’s it?

18.

19.
OPPENHEIMER: I’m teaching something no one
here’s dreamt of. But once
people start hearing what you
can do with it...
LAWRENCE (CONT’D): (grins)
There’s no going back.

INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- LATER

I stand there, expectant. A student opens the door, looks
around, embarrassed-
STUDENT: I’m sorry, I must have missed-
OPPENHEIMER: No, this is it. Mr Lomanitz, right?
LOMANITZ (twenty-one) nods, takes a seat.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): What do you know about quantum
mechanics?
LOMANITZ: I have a grasp on the basics-
OPPENHEIMER: Then you’re doing it wrong.
(rapid-fire)
Is light made up of particles or
waves?
Lomanitz opens his mouth to speak- too slow-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Quantum mechanics says it’s both-
how can it be both?
LOMANITZ: It can’t.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): It can’t. But it is. It’s
paradoxical and yet... it
works.
Lomanitz is hooked. I turn to the board, chalk out an
equation... when I turn back-
There are now FIVE students (including SERBER and SNYDER)
listening intently... I move to Lomanitz to hand him his
paper. I pat his shoulder.

19.

20.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): You’re gonna be okay.
DISSOLVE TO:: A PACKED CLASSROOM, hanging on my every word as I- now thirty-
two, slim, well-dressed, confident- teach in the round.
Lawrence listens at the edge, fascinated.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Consider a star... a vast furnace
burning in outer space...
INSERT CUT: A STAR. A SUN. BURNING, ROILING.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Fire pushing outwards against its
own gravity- balanced. But if its
furnace cools, gravity starts
winning. It contracts...
I look around. Make eye contact with Hartland SNYDER.
SNYDER: Density increases...
OPPENHEIMER: Increasing gravity...
INSERT CUT: THE SUN IS SHRINKING, MORE AND MORE RAPIDLY...
SNYDER: Increasing density. A vicious
cycle. Until... What’s the limit
here?
OPPENHEIMER: I don’t know. See where the math
takes us. I guarantee it’s
somewhere no one’s been before.
SNYDER: Me?
OPPENHEIMER: Your math’s better than mine.

20.

21.

EXT. BERKELEY -- DAY

Energetic, dashing, I STRIDE across campus, a group of
students, including Snyder and Lomanitz, following me,
hanging on my every word...
OPPENHEIMER: Einstein can’t accept the
Copenhagen interpretation-
LOMANITZ: 'God doesn’t play dice.'
OPPENHEIMER: Except he does. Bohr showed us
how...

INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- DAY

I mark up a paper. Lawrence comes in, frowns at the board.
LAWRENCE: You shouldn’t let them bring their
politics into the classroom...
I follow his look: "SATURDAY 2:00pm, RALLY FOR LOYALIST
SPAIN".:
OPPENHEIMER: I wrote that. Lawrence, you embrace
the revolution in physics, can’t
you see it everywhere else?
Picasso, Stravinsky, Freud, Marx...
LAWRENCE: This is America, Oppie. We had our
revolution. Seriously, keep it out
of the lab.
OPPENHEIMER: Well, out of the lab, my landlady’s
having a discussion group tonight.
LAWRENCE: I’ve sampled the Berkeley political
scene- it’s all philosophy
postgrads and Communists talking
integration.
OPPENHEIMER: You don’t care about integration?

21.

22.
LAWRENCE: I want to vote for it, not talk
about it. Let’s get dinner.
OPPENHEIMER: I’m meeting my brother there.
SENATOR BARTLETT (V.O.): Dr Oppenheimer’s file contained
details of FBI surveillance on his
activities at Berkeley...

INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W)

Strauss looks at the senator, cautious...
STRAUSS: Yes, as I recall.
SENATOR BARTLETT: Why would they have started a file
on Dr Oppenheimer before the war?
STRAUSS: You’d have to ask Mr Hoover.
SENATOR BARTLETT: I’m asking you, Admiral Strauss.
STRAUSS: My assumption is that it was
connected to his left-wing
political activities.
SENATOR BARTLETT: How would these activities have
come to the attention of the FBI?
STRAUSS: Well, if I remember correctly...
CUT TO::

EXT. HOUSE PARTY, SHASTA ROAD, BERKELEY -- NIGHT (COLOUR)

STRAUSS (V.O.): The FBI was taking license plates
outside suspected Communist
gatherings and his name popped up.
As I get out of my car, I spot TWO MEN checking the license
plates of cars on the street... I am GRABBED-

22.

23.
FRANK (O.S.): Gotcha!
My younger brother FRANK (twenty-five) and his date, JACKIE.

INT. LIVING ROOM, HOUSE PARTY, SHASTA ROAD, BERKELEY -- NIGHT

We ENTER the bustling room- I spot a beguiling young woman-
VOICE (O.S.): Robert! Come meet Chevalier.
Mary WASHBURN grabs my tie and leads us to Haakon CHEVALIER.
WASHBURN: Dr Haakon Chevalier, Dr Robert
Oppenheimer, and vice versa.
OPPENHEIMER: This is my little brother, Frank.
Oh, and... uh...
JACKIE: Still Jackie.
CHEVALIER: Hello, Still Jackie.
OPPENHEIMER: Chevalier. You’re in languages?
CHEVALIER: And your reputation precedes you.
OPPENHEIMER: I’m blushing- what’ve you heard?
CHEVALIER: You’re teaching a radical new
approach to physics that I have no
chance of understanding. But I
hadn’t heard you were a party
member-
OPPENHEIMER: I’m not.
FRANK: Not yet.

23.

24.
JACKIE: Frank and I are thinking of
joining-
OPPENHEIMER: (ignoring Jackie)
I support of range of causes.
Jackie, put out, leads Frank away.
CHEVALIER: The Spanish Civil War?
OPPENHEIMER: A democratic republic being
overthrown by fascist thugs? Who
wouldn’t be?
CHEVALIER: Our government- they think
socialism’s a bigger threat than
fascism.
OPPENHEIMER: Not for long- look at what the
Nazis are doing to the Jews. I send
funds to colleagues in Germany to
emigrate. I have to do something.
My own work is so... abstract.
CHEVALIER: What’re you working on?
OPPENHEIMER: What happens to stars when they
die.
CHEVALIER: Do stars die?
OPPENHEIMER: If they do they’d cool, then
collapse. And the bigger the star,
the more violent its demise. Their
gravity gets so concentrated...
INSERT CUT: THE SUN SHRINKS. THE LIGHT OF THE DISTANT STARS
BEHIND IS TUGGED TOWARDS THE DYING STAR, BENDING, STRETCHING.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): ...it swallows everything. Even
light.
CHEVALIER: Good God. Can that really happen?

24.

25.
OPPENHEIMER: The math says it can. If we can get
published, maybe one day an
astronomer finds one. But all I
have is theory. Which can’t impact
people’s lives.
CHEVALIER: If you’re sending money to Spain,
do it through the Communist Party-
they can get it to the front lines.
The beguiling young woman is there with a tray of martinis.
This is Jean TATLOCK...
TATLOCK: Mary sent me with these. I’m Jean.
OPPENHEIMER: Robert.
CHEVALIER: Haakon Chevalier. The union meeting
at Serber’s last month?
Tatlock nods. I take a glass.
CHEVALIER (CONT’D): Robert here says he’s not a
Communist.
TATLOCK: Then he doesn’t know enough about
it.
OPPENHEIMER: I’ve read Das Kapital. All three
volumes. Does that count?
CHEVALIER: That would make you better read
than most Party members.
OPPENHEIMER: It’s turgid stuff, but there’s some
thinking... 'Ownership is theft.'
TATLOCK: 'Property', not 'Ownership'.
OPPENHEIMER: Sorry, I read it in the original
German.

25.

26.
Chevalier laughs, delighted, as he leaves us alone.
TATLOCK: It’s not about the book, it’s about
the ideas. You sound uncommitted.
OPPENHEIMER: I’m committed to thinking freely
about how to improve our world. Why
limit yourself to one dogma?
TATLOCK: You’re a physicist- do you pick and
choose rules? Or do you use the
discipline to channel your energies
into progress?
OPPENHEIMER: I like a little wiggle room. Do you
always toe the party line?
Tatlock considers this. Sizes me up.
TATLOCK: I like my wiggle room, too.

INT. BEDROOM -- LATER

We are FUCKING. Hot, sweaty, a little brutal. Tatlock GIVES
UP, climbs off me-
OPPENHEIMER: Wait, wait-
I catch my breath, watching her STUDY my shelves.
TATLOCK: Unexpected.
OPPENHEIMER: What?
TATLOCK: For a physicist.
OPPENHEIMER: You’ve only got a shelf full of
Freud?
TATLOCK: Actually my background’s more-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Jungian.

26.

27.
TATLOCK (CONT’D): You know analysis.
OPPENHEIMER: When I was a postgrad at Cambridge
I had some trouble.
She turns to me.
TATLOCK: I’ll bite.
OPPENHEIMER: I tried to poison my tutor.
TATLOCK: Did you hate him?
OPPENHEIMER: I liked him very much.
Tatlock turns back to the books.
TATLOCK: You just needed to get laid.
OPPENHEIMER: Wow. Took my analysts two years,
and I’m not sure they ever put it
that succinctly.
TATLOCK: You had them convinced you’re more
complicated than you really are.
OPPENHEIMER: We’re all simple souls, I guess.
TATLOCK: Not me.
She pulls a book from the shelf: THE BHAGAVAD GITA. She opens
the book to find INCOMPREHENSIBLE CHARACTERS.
TATLOCK (CONT’D): What’s this?
OPPENHEIMER: Sanskrit.
TATLOCK: You can read this?

27.

28.
OPPENHEIMER: I’m learning-
She climbs on top of me, opens the book in my face.
TATLOCK: Go on then.
I study the page as Tatlock starts to move.
OPPENHEIMER: In this part, Vishnu reveals
his multi-armed self-
TATLOCK (CONT’D): Read the words.
She points to each word as I translate...
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): 'And now I am become Death...
She nods, impressed, starts moving again...
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): ...destroyer of worlds.'

EXT. NEW MEXICO -- DAY

Moving over the VAST landscape to find three tiny figures. I
lead Lawrence and Frank on horseback up a mountain trail.

EXT. CAMPSITE -- EVENING

THUNDER. Lawrence climbs off his horse. The wind WHIPS as we
set up our tent...
OPPENHEIMER: It’ll break before dawn. The air
cools overnight. Just before dawn,
the storm dies.

INT./EXT. TENT -- NIGHT

Lawrence, Frank and I huddle in the BUFFETING TENT, trying to
keep a fire going in the WIND and RAIN outside the tent.
FRANK: I’m getting married.
LAWRENCE: Congratulations, Frank.
I look at Frank, sardonic with drink.

28.

29.
OPPENHEIMER: To Jackie?
Frank stares at me... the tent stops buffeting...
FRANK: Yeah, to Jackie. The waitress.
LAWRENCE: (sensing tension)
Oppie, you’re right- it’s letting
up. I’ll see if there’s any stars.
Frank watches Lawrence go, then pounces-
FRANK: All your talk about the common man
but Jackie’s not good enough? We
join the Party- you can’t hide your
disapproval- why? Because that’s
supposed to be your thing?
OPPENHEIMER: I haven’t joined the Party, Frank.
And I don’t think she should’ve
convinced you to, either-
FRANK: Half the faculty’s Communist-
OPPENHEIMER: Not that half.
I point in the direction Lawrence wondered off.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): I’m your brother and I want you to
be cautious.
FRANK: And I want to wring your neck.
I giggle at this. Frank shakes his head, then starts
laughing, too. I grab Frank’s shoulder. Frank looks up...
FRANK (CONT’D): Robert, I won’t live my life afraid
to make a mistake.
I hold up my hands in defeat-
OPPENHEIMER: You’re happy, I’m happy.

29.

30.
FRANK: Then I’m happy you’re happy.

EXT. PERRO CALIENTE -- MOMENTS LATER

I approach Lawrence, who stares up at the stars.
LAWRENCE: It’s so clear I feel like I could
see one of those dark stars you’re
working on...
OPPENHEIMER: You can’t, that’s the whole point.
INSERT CUT: AN EXPANDING DARKNESS EATS THE STARS...
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Their gravity swallows light. It’s
like a kind of... hole in space.
LAWRENCE: Is Frank okay?
OPPENHEIMER: Yeah. He just has a shitty brother.
Lawrence smiles at this. Looks around, then-
LAWRENCE: It’s special here.
OPPENHEIMER: As a kid I thought if I could find
a way to combine physics and New
Mexico, my life would be perfect.
LAWRENCE: It’s a little remote for that.
Let’s get some sleep.
I turn, heading to the tent. Lawrence follows.
OPPENHEIMER: That mesa we saw today? One of my
favorite places in the world.
Tomorrow we’ll climb it.
LAWRENCE: What’s it called?
My response is so soft it is almost swallowed by the dark...

30.

31.
OPPENHEIMER: Los Alamos.

EXT. STREET, BERKELEY -- DAY

Tatlock and I walk down the sidewalk. I try to take her hand-
she folds her arms.
TATLOCK: I wasn’t expecting to see you.
OPPENHEIMER: I have to make an appointment?
Across the street a young man BURSTS out of the BARBER SHOP,
towel across chest, NEWSPAPER in hand... the barber runs out-
the young man rips off the towel, TOSSES it to him and RUNS-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Alvarez!
I leave Tatlock on the sidewalk, take off after Alvarez-

EXT. BERKELEY CAMPUS -- DAY

Alvarez SPRINTS, newspaper in hand- I follow-

INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- CONTINUOUS

I BURST in- Lawrence is trying to calm Alvarez-
ALVAREZ: (breathless)
They’ve done it! Hahn and Strassman
in Germany...
Alvarez tosses the paper at me-
ALVAREZ (CONT’D): They split the uranium nucleus.
LAWRENCE: How?
OPPENHEIMER: (reading)
Bombarded it with neutrons.
ALVAREZ: Lawrence, it’s fission. Nuclear
fission. They’ve split the atom...

31.

32.
OPPENHEIMER: It’s not possible.
I put down the paper, take up my chalk like it’s a weapon,
move to the board. Alvarez grabs the paper-
ALVAREZ: I’m going to try to reproduce it.
Alvarez and Lawrence leave. I write and write...

INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- LATER

Lawrence enters. I turn. Point at the board.
OPPENHEIMER: See. It can’t be done.
LAWRENCE: Very elegant. Quite clear. Just one
problem...
OPPENHEIMER: Where?
LAWRENCE: Next door. Alvarez did it.

INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- MOMENTS LATER

I peer at Alvarez’s oscilloscope...
LAWRENCE: Theory will take you only so far.
I stand, moving away... thinking...
OPPENHEIMER: During the process extra neutrons
boil off. Which could be used to
split other uranium atoms...
LAWRENCE: A chain reaction. You’re thinking
what I’m thinking.
OPPENHEIMER: You, me and every physicist around
the world who’s seen the news.
ALVAREZ: What? What’re we all thinking?

32.

33.
OPPENHEIMER: A bomb, Alvarez. A bomb.

EXT. TATLOCK HOUSE, BERKELEY -- NIGHT

Tatlock GRABS a bouquet out of my hands-
TATLOCK: I told you, Robert, no more fucking
flowers.
She dumps them in the trash. I just stare.
OPPENHEIMER: I don’t understand what you
want from me-
TATLOCK (CONT’D): I don’t want anything from
you.
I pause. Then, gently...
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): You say that. Then you call.
Tatlock kicks at the dirt.
TATLOCK: Don’t answer.
OPPENHEIMER: I’ll always answer.
She looks up at me.
TATLOCK: Fine. But no more flowers.
She goes inside-
OPPENHEIMER: Aren’t you coming?
Slams the door shut behind her. I stand there.
CHEVALIER (O.S.): You have to know when you’re
beaten, Robert.
I turn. Chevalier and his wife, BARBARA, wait in the car.
OPPENHEIMER: It’s not that simple, Haakon.

33.

34.

INT. MEETING HALL, BERKELEY -- NIGHT

Chevalier and Barbara lead me into the crowded hall. A
BANNER: "FEDERATION OF ARCHITECTS, ENGINEERS, CHEMISTS AND
TECHNICIANS".: A man with a British accent greets us. This is ELTENTON.
ELTENTON: Chevalier, good to see you. And the
illustrious Dr Oppenheimer. I’m
Eltenton. Might you say a word
about organized labour on campuses?
OPPENHEIMER: I’ll try to think of something.
Eltenton guides me towards the stage...
ELTENTON: I work at Shell, we’ve signed up
chemists and engineers...
OPPENHEIMER: That’s excellent.
I spot Lomanitz, who grins and waves...
ELTENTON: So why not scientists in academia?
OPPENHEIMER: Sure. When do we-
Eltenton pushes me onto the stage. People start APPLAUDING at
the very sight of me. I can’t quite not smile about this.

INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- DAY

I watch Lawrence examine his cyclotron.
OPPENHEIMER: Teachers are unionized, Lawrence.
Why not professors?
LAWRENCE: Don’t you have somewhere to be?
OPPENHEIMER: Academics have rights, too-

34.

35.
LAWRENCE: It’s not that. I have a group
coming.
OPPENHEIMER: I’ll sit in.
LAWRENCE: Not this one.
The door opens. Richard TOLMAN and Vannevar BUSH enter-
OPPENHEIMER: Richard. Dr Bush. What brings you
two up north?
They exchange glances with Lawrence. Awkward SILENCE. I rise,
letting them off the hook-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Richard, tell Ruth I’ll be down to
Pasadena Thursday.

INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- CONTINUOUS

As I enter, a magazine FLAPS into my hands from across the
room. Students are all reading copies...
SERBER: Your paper on black holes- it’s in!
I open the magazine as I turn to a STUDENT-
OPPENHEIMER: Get Hartland.
LOMANITZ: September 1st, 1939- the world’s
gonna remember this day...
Snyder comes in with a newspaper. Glum.
OPPENHEIMER: Hartland, our paper, it’s in print!
SNYDER: We’ve been upstaged.
He holds up the paper: "HITLER INVADES POLAND".
OPPENHEIMER (V.O.): During the Battle of France and the
Battle of Britain...

35.

36.

INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY

Robb looks on intently as I turn the page on my statement...
OPPENHEIMER: ...I found myself increasingly out
of sympathy with the policy of
neutrality that Communists
advocated.
ROBB: And after Hitler invaded Russia,
did these Communist sympathies
return?
OPPENHEIMER: No. If you’ll just allow me
to-
GRAY: Mr Robb, you’ll have ample
opportunity to cross-examine.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): I need to make clear that my
changing opinion of Russia did not
mean a sharp break with those who
held different views. For a year or
two during a previous marriage my
wife, Kitty, had been a Communist
Party member.
Behind me, on a couch, is KITTY (forty-six), listening
intently...
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): But when I first met her, in
Pasadena in 1939, she had already
disengaged from politics...

INT. HOUSE PARTY, TOLMAN HOUSE, PASADENA -- NIGHT

Kitty (thirty-one) watches as I EXPERTLY open the liquor
cabinet-
OPPENHEIMER: This is where I keep the good
stuff.
KITTY: I thought this was the Tolmans’
house.
OPPENHEIMER: I live with them when I’m at
Caltech.

36.

37.
RUTH (O.S.): You two need anything?
I turn to see RUTH TOLMAN (forty-five) looking at me,
mischievous.
OPPENHEIMER: We’re fine, Ruthie.
(to Kitty)
You’re a biologist?
KITTY: Somehow I graduated to housewife.
Can you explain quantum mechanics
to me? It seems baffling.
OPPENHEIMER: It is. This glass-
I thump a glass onto the cabinet- pour a drink-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): This drink-
I hand her the glass- fingers touching...
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Our bodies... are mostly empty
space- groupings of tiny energy
waves bound together.
KITTY: By what?
OPPENHEIMER: Forces of attraction strong enough
to convince us that matter is
solid...
I push the palm of my hand up against hers.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): And stop my body passing through
yours.
Kitty pushes her fingers through mine, interlacing our hands.
I look at a GREY-HAIRED MAN in conversation with Tolman...
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): You’re married to Dr Harrison.
KITTY: Not very.

37.
(MORE):

38.
OPPENHEIMER: Well, there’s someone that I...
KITTY: Does she feel the same way?
OPPENHEIMER: Sometimes. Not often enough.
As Ruth looks our way I let Kitty’s hand go.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): I’m going to New Mexico, to my
ranch. With friends. You should
come.
Kitty looks meaningfully over her glass at me.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): I meant with your husband.
KITTY: Yes, you did. Because you know it
won’t make a bit of difference.

EXT. PERRO CALIENTE -- DAY

Kitty and I THUNDER along on horseback, climbing a ridge. I
shout ahead to Kitty-
OPPENHEIMER: Why did you marry him?!
Kitty pulls up. I come alongside.
KITTY: I was lost. He was kind.
OPPENHEIMER: Lost?
KITTY: My previous husband died. At twenty-
eight I wasn’t ready to be a widow.
Kitty DISMOUNTS. I follow.
OPPENHEIMER: Who was your first husband?
KITTY: Nobody. But my second husband was
Joe Dallet.
(MORE):

38.
KITTY (CONT’D):

39.
From money, like me, but he was a
union organizer in Youngstown,
Ohio. I fell hard.
OPPENHEIMER: How hard?
KITTY: Hard enough to spend four years
living off beans and pancakes,
handing out the Daily Worker at
factory gates.
Kitty takes out a hip flask. SWIGS.
KITTY (CONT’D): By ’36 I told Joe I couldn’t take
it anymore, quit the Party and
joined my parents swanning around
Europe. A year later I said I
wanted him back. Him, not the Daily
Worker. He said 'Swell, I’ll meet
you on my way to Spain.'
She hands me the flask. I take a drink.
OPPENHEIMER: He went to fight for the loyalists?
KITTY: On his way we reconciled. One
beautiful week in Paris. Then he
went to the brigades and I waited.
One day Steve Nelson turns up in
the lobby of the hotel to tell me
Joe got himself killed first time
he popped out of his trench.
OPPENHEIMER: Who’s Steve Nelson?
KITTY: Head of the Communist Party in San
Francisco. You don’t know him?
OPPENHEIMER: I’m not a Communist.
KITTY: You seem to know a lot of ’em.
OPPENHEIMER: Including you.
KITTY (CONT’D):

39.

40.
KITTY: (shakes head)
Ideology got Joe killed. For
nothing.
OPPENHEIMER: The Spanish Republic isn’t nothing.
KITTY: My husband offered both our futures
to stop one fascist bullet
embedding itself in a mudbank.
That’s the definition of nothing.
OPPENHEIMER: That seems a little reductive-
KITTY: Pragmatic. Steve and his wife
brought me home with them to
Chicago, then set me up with
husband number three. Now here I
am...
She looks around at the wilderness...
KITTY (CONT’D): Wherever the hell this is-
I grab her. Kiss her, hard.

INT. TATLOCK’S BEDROOM -- DAY

Tatlock and I sit on the floor, backs to the bed like kids.
Tatlock has been crying.
OPPENHEIMER: I didn’t want you to hear it from
someone else.
TATLOCK: You didn’t bring flowers. That’s
something.
I reach into my pocket- she GRABS the small posy from me,
TOSSING it aside.
OPPENHEIMER: Jean, we both know I’m not what you
want.
TATLOCK: Yeah. But it’s a door closing.

40.

41.
OPPENHEIMER: Not as far as I’m concerned.
Tatlock looks at me. Appreciating the sentiment.
TATLOCK: You knocked her up. Fast work.
OPPENHEIMER: Can’t keep a good man down.
TATLOCK: I meant her. She knew what she
wanted. What about the husband?
OPPENHEIMER: We spoke. He’s divorcing her so we
can get married before she’s
showing.
TATLOCK: How civilized, you idiot. This is
your community- you think rules
don’t apply to the golden boy?
OPPENHEIMER: Brilliance makes up for a lot.
TATLOCK: Don’t alienate the only people in
the world who understand what you
do. One day you might need them.

INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- DAY

I write "F.A.E.C.T." on the board, Lomanitz hands out FLIERS.
Lawrence enters, GRABBING a flyer from the nearest student: "UNIONIZE THE RADIATION LAB".
LAWRENCE: Lomanitz? What do you make a month?
LOMANITZ: (sheepish)
A hundred and fifty dollars.
Lawrence turns to another student-
LAWRENCE: How are the working conditions?
OPPENHEIMER: That’s not the point, Lawrence.

41.
(MORE):

42.
LAWRENCE: What do you have in common with
dock workers and farm labourers?
LOMANITZ: Plenty-
LAWRENCE: Right. Everybody out. Now!
(to me)
Not you.
The students file out. Lawrence SLAMS the door- turns on me-
LAWRENCE (CONT’D): What’re you doing?!
OPPENHEIMER: It’s a trade union-
LAWRENCE: Full of Communists!
OPPENHEIMER: So? I haven’t joined the Party-
LAWRENCE: They won’t let me bring you onto
the project because of this shit!
They won’t even let me tell you
what the project is-
OPPENHEIMER: I know what the fucking project is,
Lawrence! We all heard about
Einstein and Szilard’s letter to
Roosevelt. Warning him the Germans
could make a bomb. And I know what
it means for the Nazis to have a
bomb.
LAWRENCE: I don’t?
OPPENHEIMER: It’s not your people they’re
herding into camps! It’s mine!
LAWRENCE: You think I tell them about your
politics? Next time you’re coming
home from a meeting, take a look in
the rear-view mirror.
(MORE):

42.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D): 
43.
Listen for sounds on your phone
line. And stop being so goddamn
naïve.
I’m taken aback by this...
OPPENHEIMER: Why would they care what I do?
LAWRENCE: Because you’re not just self-
important, you’re actually
important.
I see the reality. Shift gears-
OPPENHEIMER: I get it. You don’t have to worry.
I get it.
LAWRENCE: You just need to be more-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Pragmatic. It’s done,
Lawrence. I’ll talk to
Lomanitz and the others. You
don’t have to worry.
Lawrence looks at me. Sees this is real.
LAWRENCE (CONT’D): Then welcome to the war.
OPPENHEIMER (V.O.): I filled out my first security
questionnaire...

INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY

I glance up from my notes.
OPPENHEIMER: ...and was informed that my
involvement in left-wing groups
would not prove a bar to my work on
the atomic programme.
SENATOR PASTORE (V.O.): Why were his Communist associations
not seen as a security risk during
the war?

LAWRENCE (CONT’D):

INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W)

Strauss suppresses his irritation at the line of questioning.
STRAUSS: Senator, I can’t possibly answer
for a security clearance granted
years before I even met the man.
SENATOR PASTORE: Fine. What about after?
STRAUSS: After the war, Dr Oppenheimer was
the most respected scientific voice
in the world. That’s why I asked
him to run the Institute, that’s
why he advised the Atomic Energy
Commission. Simple as that.

INT. SENATE OFFICE -- DAY (B&W)

Strauss paces-
STRAUSS: What are they accusing me of?
SENATE AIDE: I think they just want to know what
happened between 1947 and 1954 to
change your mind on Oppenheimer’s
security clearance.
STRAUSS: I didn’t. I was the AEC Chairman,
but it wasn’t me who brought the
charges against Robert.
SENATE AIDE: Who did?
STRAUSS: Some former staff member of the
Joint Congressional Committee-
INSERT CUT: A YOUNG MAN LEAFS THROUGH A FILE, COLLECTING HIS
THOUGHTS... THIS IS WILLIAM BORDEN... HE STARTS TYPING...
STRAUSS (CONT’D): A rabid anti-Communist named
Borden. He wrote to the FBI
demanding they take action.

44.

45.
SENATE AIDE: The FBI? Why not come to the AEC
direct?
STRAUSS: Why get caught holding the knife
yourself?
SENATE AIDE: What did Borden have against
Oppenheimer?
STRAUSS: This was the McCarthy era- people
hounded out of jobs for any hint of
red... reading Oppenheimer’s
security file- his Communist
brother, sister-in-law, fiancée,
best friend, wife... that’s before
you even get to the Chevalier
incident.
SENATE AIDE: But how would Borden have access to
Oppenheimer’s security file?
STRAUSS: Someone gave it to him. Someone who
wanted Oppenheimer silenced.
SENATE AIDE: Who?
STRAUSS: Who knows? Robert didn’t take care
not to upset the power brokers in
Washington. His opinions on the
atom became definitive and he
wasn’t always patient with us mere
mortals. I came in for plenty of
harsh treatment. There was an AEC
vote on the export of isotopes to
Norway...

INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W)

Oppenheimer sits at the witness table with Joe VOLPE, the AEC
lawyer. Strauss is in the audience.
STRAUSS (V.O.): They drafted in Robert to make me
look like a fool...

45.

46.
CONGRESSMAN: But, Dr Oppenheimer, one member of
the AEC board thinks these isotopes
could be useful to our enemies in
the production of atomic weapons.
OPPENHEIMER: Congressman, you could use a shovel
in making atomic weapons, in fact,
you do. You could use a bottle of
beer in making atomic weapons. In
fact, you do.
LAUGHTER. Strauss squirms, embarrassed.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Isotopes aren’t as useful as
electronic components, but more
useful than a sandwich. I’d put
them somewhere in between.
Volpe looks at Strauss, who SMILES, GOOD-HUMOURED...
STRAUSS (V.O.): Genius is no guarantee of wisdom.
How could this man who saw so much
be so blind?

INT. OPPENHEIMER HOUSE, BERKELEY -- NIGHT (COLOUR)

I come in. The lights are off. A BABY’S CRIES echo...
OPPENHEIMER: Kitty?
She is in the dining room, in the dark, drink in hand.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Kitty, the project- I’m in.
She sips. SLIDES her drink down the table at me-
KITTY: Let’s celebrate.
As the baby CRIES, Kitty comes to me, pulling at my clothes-
OPPENHEIMER: Don’t you need to go to him?

46.

47.
KITTY: I’ve been going to him all fucking
day...
She moves to kiss my neck- I look upstairs- she PUSHES me
away- GRABS her drink...

EXT./INT. CHEVALIER HOUSE -- NIGHT

I carry the crying infant, PETER, to the front door. Knock.
Barbara opens it- sees my distraught face and takes Peter.

INT. LIVING ROOM, CHEVALIER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Chevalier hands me a drink. I stare into the liquid.
OPPENHEIMER: I’m ashamed to ask.
CHEVALIER: Anything.
OPPENHEIMER: Take Peter.
CHEVALIER: Sure.
OPPENHEIMER: No, for a while, Hoke. A while.
CHEVALIER: Does Kitty know you’re here?
OPPENHEIMER: (I laugh)
Of course she fucking knows! We’re
awful. Selfish, awful people...
(I down drink)
Forget I asked-
Chevalier puts out a hand to stop me rising...
CHEVALIER: Robert, you see beyond the world we
live in. There’s a price to be paid
for that. Of course we’ll help.

47.

48.

EXT. NEW MEXICO -- EVENING

Kitty and I GALLOP through the trees, EMERGING into the
twilight overlooking a valley. Kitty turns to the wind.
KITTY: Everything’s changing, Robert.
OPPENHEIMER: Having a child was always-
KITTY (CONT’D): (impatient)
The world is pivoting in some
new direction... reforming...
this is your moment.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): We’re putting together a
group to study feasibility-
KITTY (CONT’D): 'We' shouldn’t be doing
anything. You should.
Lawrence won’t get this done.
Or Tolman, or Rabi. You will.

INT. PRESIDENT’S DINING HALL, BERKELEY -- DAY

A crowded and lavish lunch. I notice a large man in ARMY
UNIFORM, Colonel GROVES, sitting next to another soldier
(NICHOLS) with Bush and Tolman. I sidle up to Lawrence at the
buffet.
OPPENHEIMER: Who’s the uniform?
The husky GROVES spills sauce on his tunic, wipes at it.
LAWRENCE: I thought you might know.

INT. CLASSROOM, BERKELEY -- AFTERNOON

I am working. Groves and Lieutenant Colonel NICHOLS enter.
GROVES: Dr Oppenheimer. I’m Colonel Groves,
this is Lieutenant Colonel Nichols.
Groves pulls off his uniform jacket, TOSSES it to Nichols.
GROVES (CONT’D): Get that dry-cleaned.
I watch Nichols leave.

48.

49.
OPPENHEIMER: If that’s how you treat a
lieutenant colonel, I’d hate to see
how you treat a humble physicist.
GROVES: If I ever meet one I’ll let you
know.
OPPENHEIMER: Ouch.
GROVES: Theatres of combat all over the
world- but I have to stay in
Washington.
OPPENHEIMER: Why?
GROVES: I built the Pentagon. The brass
likes it so much they made me take
over the Manhattan Engineer
District.
OPPENHEIMER: Which is?
GROVES: Don’t be a smart-ass. You know damn
well what it is- you and half of
every physics department across
America. That’s problem number one.
OPPENHEIMER: I thought problem number one would
be securing enough uranium ore.
GROVES: Twelve hundred tons. Bought the day
I took charge.
OPPENHEIMER: Processing?
GROVES: Just broke ground at Oak Ridge,
Tennessee. Now I’m looking for a
project director.
OPPENHEIMER: And my name came up.

49.

50.
GROVES: Nope. Even though you brought
quantum physics to America. That
made me curious.
OPPENHEIMER: What have you found out?
GROVES: You’re a dilettante, womanizer,
suspected Communist-
OPPENHEIMER: I’m a New Deal Democrat-
GROVES: I said 'suspected'. Unstable,
theatrical, egotistical, neurotic.
OPPENHEIMER: Nothing good? Not even 'he’s
brilliant, but'...?
GROVES: Brilliance is taken for granted in
your circles. So, no. Only one
person said anything good- Richard
Tolman. He thinks you’ve got
integrity. But Tolman strikes me as
someone who knows science better
than people.
OPPENHEIMER: Yet here you are. You don’t take
much on trust.
GROVES: I don’t take anything on trust. Why
don’t you have a Nobel Prize?
OPPENHEIMER: Why aren’t you a general?
GROVES: They’re making me one for this.
OPPENHEIMER: Maybe I’ll have the same luck.
GROVES: A Nobel Prize for making a bomb?
OPPENHEIMER: Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

50.
(MORE):

51.
GROVES: So how would you proceed?
OPPENHEIMER: You’re talking about turning theory
into a practical weapons system
faster than the Nazis.
GROVES: Who have a twelve-month head start.
OPPENHEIMER: Eighteen.
GROVES: How could you possibly know that?
OPPENHEIMER: Our fast neutron research took six
months- the man they’ve undoubtedly
put in charge will have made that
leap instantly.
GROVES: Who do you think they put in
charge?
OPPENHEIMER: Werner Heisenberg. He has the most
intuitive understanding of atomic
structure I’ve ever seen.
GROVES: You know his work?
OPPENHEIMER: I know him. Just like I know
Walther Bothe. Von Weizsäcker.
Diebner. In a straight race, the
Germans win. We’ve got one hope.
GROVES: Which is?
OPPENHEIMER: Anti-Semitism.
GROVES: What?
OPPENHEIMER: Hitler called quantum physics
'Jewish science'. Said it right to
Einstein’s face.
(MORE):

51.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D):

52.
Our one hope is that Hitler’s so
blinded by hate he’s denied
Heisenberg proper resources.
Because it’ll take vast resources.
Our nation’s best scientists,
working together- right now they’re
scattered.
GROVES: Which gives us
compartmentalization.
OPPENHEIMER: All minds have to see the whole
task to contribute efficiently.
Poor security may cost us the race,
inefficiency will. The Germans know
more than us, anyway.
GROVES: The Russians don’t.
OPPENHEIMER: Remind me- who are we at war with?
GROVES: Someone with your past doesn’t want
to be seen downplaying the
importance of security from our
Communist allies.
OPPENHEIMER: Point taken. But no.
GROVES: You don’t get to say 'no' to me-
OPPENHEIMER: It’s my job to say 'no' to you when
you’re wrong-
GROVES: So you’ve got the job, now?
OPPENHEIMER: I’m considering it.
GROVES: I’m starting to see how you got
your reputation. My favorite
response? 'Oppenheimer couldn’t run
a hamburger stand.'
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D):

52.

53.
OPPENHEIMER: I couldn’t. But I can run the
Manhattan Project.
I turn to the blackboard. Take up my chalk.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): There’s a way to balance these
things...
(I draw)
Leave the Rad Lab here at Berkeley
under Lawrence, Met Lab in Chicago
under Szilard, large-scale refining-
where’d you say? Tennessee... all
America’s industrial might and
scientific innovation, connected by
rail... focused on one goal, one
point in space and time, coming
together... here.
I have drawn a cross at the centre of the diagram.
GROVES: And where’s that?
INSERT CUT: A BARBED-WIRE FENCE IS STRUNG OUT...
OPPENHEIMER: A secret labouratory. In the middle
of nowhere. Self-sufficient.
Secure. Equipment, housing, the
works. We keep everyone there till
it’s done.
INSERT CUT: A SCHOOLHOUSE IS ERECTED. A CHURCH. A STORE...
OPPENHEIMER (V.O.): It’ll need a school, stores, a
church...

INT. TRAIN, BERKELEY TO WASHINGTON, DC -- DAY

I talk to Groves as Nichols looks on...
GROVES: Why?

53.

54.
OPPENHEIMER: If we don’t let scientists bring
their families, we’ll never get the
best. You want security? Build a
town, and build it fast.
GROVES: Where?

EXT. CAR, LOS ALAMOS -- CONTINUOUS

Groves emerges, squinting into the brightness, taking in the
stark beauty. I greet him, arms spread wide.
OPPENHEIMER: Welcome to Los Alamos. There’s a
boys’ school we’ll have to
commandeer, and the local Indians
come up here for burial rites.
Other than that, nothing for forty
miles any direction. And south-
east, hundreds of miles of desert.
Enough to find the perfect spot.
GROVES: For?
OPPENHEIMER: Success.
Groves scans the horizon. Sniffs the air... turns to Nichols.
GROVES: Build him a town. Fast.
(to Oppenheimer)
Let’s go recruit some scientists.

INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO BOSTON -- NIGHT

I watch Groves go over a file.
OPPENHEIMER: How much can I tell them?
GROVES: (without looking up)
As much as you like, till you feel
my boot on your balls.

54.

55.

INT. LECTURE HALL, HARVARD -- DAY

Groves and I sit talking to BAINBRIDGE and DONALD.
BAINBRIDGE: I’m not a soldier, Oppie.
OPPENHEIMER: Soldier? He’s a general-
(jab my thumb at Groves)
I got all the soldier I need. Maybe
too much. I’m here because you know
isotopes, and you-
(to Donald)
know explosives better than anyone.
DONALD: But you can’t tell us what you’re
doing?
I glance at Groves. Then CROSS my legs.
OPPENHEIMER: It’s about unleashing the strong
force before the Nazis do.
BAINBRIDGE: Oh my God.

INT. CORRIDOR, MIT -- DAY

Groves and I walk with CONDON.
CONDON: Why? Why would I leave my family?
OPPENHEIMER: I told you, bring your family.
CONDON: Why would we go to the middle of
nowhere for who knows how long?
OPPENHEIMER: A year or two. Or three.
CONDON: Why would you think I’d do that?
Groves SNAPS like a bulldog-

55.

56.
GROVES: Why? Why? How about because this is
the most important fucking thing
that’s ever happened in the history
of the world? How about that?
I look at Groves, then SHRUG at Condon.

INT. OFFICE, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN -- NIGHT

Groves and I sit across the desk from a CONCERNED SCIENTIST.
CONCERNED SCIENTIST: Robert, I hear you. I hear you.
Concerned Scientist GLANCES at Groves then DROPS his gaze.
OPPENHEIMER: General, could you give us a
minute?
Groves looks at me. Gets up and goes.
CONCERNED SCIENTIST: They’re not gonna let someone like
me onto this project. And failing a
security check isn’t gonna be good
for a career even after the war.
OPPENHEIMER: So you’re a fellow traveler, so
what? This is a national emergency.
I’ve got some skeletons, and
they’ve put me in charge. They need
us.
CONCERNED SCIENTIST: Until they don’t.

INT. QUADRANGLE, PRINCETON -- DAY

Groves and I flank FEYNMAN as he hurries across the quad-
OPPENHEIMER: Heisenberg, Diebner, Bothe, Bohr...
what do these men have in common?
FEYNMAN: The greatest minds on atomic
theory.

56.

57.
OPPENHEIMER: And?
FEYNMAN: I don’t know...
OPPENHEIMER: The Nazis have them.
FEYNMAN: Niels Bohr is in Copenhagen.
OPPENHEIMER: Under Nazi occupation. Did they
stop printing newspapers in
Princeton?
FEYNMAN: Niels won’t work for the Nazis.
OPPENHEIMER: No. Never. But while they have him,
we don’t. So I need you.

INT. TRAIN, PRINCETON TO SANTA FE -- NIGHT

Groves is napping. I just start talking.
OPPENHEIMER: Is there any chance of getting Bohr
out of Denmark?
GROVES: No dice. I checked with the
British. Until we get Allied boots
back onto the continent there’s no
way. Is he that important?
INSERT CUT: BOHR GESTICULATES WITH THE POISONED APPLE.
OPPENHEIMER: How many people do you know who’ve
proven Einstein wrong?
The train BUMPS. I look out the window, impatient.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): It’d be quicker to take a plane.
GROVES: We can’t risk a plane. America
needs us.

57.

58.

EXT. LOS ALAMOS UNDER CONSTRUCTION -- DAY

Dressed in ARMY UNIFORM, I show Rabi and Condon the CHAOTIC
SNOWY and MUDDY mesa. CONSTRUCTION CREWS at work. Feynman
approaches-
FEYNMAN: The Harvard guys say the building’s
too small for their cyclotron.
OPPENHEIMER: (to Condon)
Get ’em together with the
architects.
Condon hurries off with Feynman. Rabi turns to me.
RABI: When’s this place supposed to open?
OPPENHEIMER: Two months.
RABI: (shakes head)
Robert, you’re the great
improviser, but this you can’t do
in your head...

INT. CONSTRUCTION CABIN, LOS ALAMOS -- MOMENTS LATER

I draw on the board.
OPPENHEIMER: Four divisions- Experimental,
Theoretical, Metallurgical,
Ordnance.
RABI: Who’s running Theoretical?
OPPENHEIMER: I am.
RABI: That’s what I was afraid of. You’re
spread too thin.
OPPENHEIMER: So you take Theoretical.
RABI: I’m not coming here, Robert.

58.

59.
OPPENHEIMER: Why not?
Rabi, seldom at a loss for words, is lost for words...
RABI: You drop a bomb and it falls on the
just and the unjust. I don’t wish
the culmination of three centuries
of physics to be a weapon of mass
destruction.
OPPENHEIMER: Izzy, I don’t know if we can be
trusted with such a weapon, but I
know the Nazis can’t. We have no
choice.
RABI: Well, the second thing you have to
do is appoint Hans Bethe to head
the Theoretical division.
OPPENHEIMER: Wait, what was the first?
RABI: Take off that ridiculous uniform-
you’re a scientist.
OPPENHEIMER: General Groves is insisting we
join.
RABI: Tell Groves to shit in his hat.
They need us for who we are. So be
yourself, only... better.

INT. OPPENHEIMER’S OFFICE, LOS ALAMOS -- DAY

I pull on a jacket. Run a hand through newly shorn close-
cropped dark hair. Put on a PORK PIE HAT. Pick up my pipe...

EXT. LOS ALAMOS UNDER CONSTRUCTION -- MOMENTS LATER

I walk the main drag like a SHERIFF, nodding at construction
workers as I pass... THE ICONIC J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER.

59.

60.

INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- DAY

I look down onto the bustle of students. Lomanitz looks up
and waves- then is ERASED by WHITEWASH as workers COVER the
windows... Serber hands me a key.
SERBER: This is the only key. Teller’s here
already. Shall I show him in?
OPPENHEIMER: No, wait for the others-
The door BURSTS OPEN and a stooped, slightly heavy young man
shuffles in. This is EDWARD TELLER.
TELLER: Let’s get started.
OPPENHEIMER: Hello, Edward.

INT. SAME -- DAY

I sit at the front, one long leg tucked under my ass. The
scientists include Lawrence, Serber, Teller, BETHE, Condon,
Tolman, Feynman, Donald, Bainbridge, NEDDERMEYER and Alvarez.
OPPENHEIMER: We’ll work here until the T-section
at Los Alamos is finished-
I see Teller waving a piece of paper-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Edward, can I get through my
summary?
TELLER: This is more important.
Teller’s paper is passed around the room, scientists
PALING...:
TELLER (CONT’D): Calculating chain reactions... I
found a rather troubling
possibility.
Hans Bethe hands me the paper, turns to Teller.

60.

61.
BETHE: That can’t be right. Show me how
you did your calculations.
TELLER: Of course.
I look up from the paper, grave. Teller watches the ruckus
he’s caused with evident satisfaction. Bethe approaches.
BETHE: Oppie, this is fantasy. Teller’s
calculations cannot be right.
OPPENHEIMER: Do them yourself while I go to
Princeton.
BETHE: What for?
OPPENHEIMER: To talk to Einstein.
BETHE: There’s not much common ground
between you two.
OPPENHEIMER: That’s why I should get his view.

EXT. WOODS, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY -- DAY

I walk through the trees, gaining on two figures. The two men
turn. One of them is Einstein.
EINSTEIN: Dr Oppenheimer. Have you met Kurt
Gödel? We walk here most days.
GÖDEL: Trees are the most inspiring
structures.
OPPENHEIMER: Albert, might I have a word?
Einstein senses the gravity. Nods. We leave Gödel staring up
at the bare trees.

61.

62.
EINSTEIN: Some days Kurt refuses to eat. Even
in Princeton, he’s convinced the
Nazis can poison his food.

EXT. LAKE, INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY -- MOMENTS LATER

Einstein and I emerge from the trees. I pull a piece of paper
from my breast pocket. Einstein takes it.
EINSTEIN: Whose work is this?
OPPENHEIMER: Teller’s.
EINSTEIN: And what do you take it to mean?
OPPENHEIMER: Neutron smashes into nucleus
releasing neutrons to smash into
other nuclei...
INSERT CUT: DARKNESS SPLIT BY GLOWING PARTICLES FIRING INTO
EACH OTHER IN AN INCREASINGLY VIOLENT DISPLAY...
OPPENHEIMER: Criticality- the point of no return-
massive explosive force... but the
chain reaction doesn’t stop...
Einstein studies the paper... he nods.
EINSTEIN: It would ignite the atmosphere.
The air around us CATCHES FIRE... THE PLANET EARTH, LONELY IN
VAST DARKNESS, IS SUDDENLY ENGULFED IN FIRE.
OPPENHEIMER: When we detonate an atomic device,
we might start a chain reaction
that destroys the world.
EINSTEIN: And here we are, lost in your
quantum world of probabilities, but
needing certainty.

62.

63.
OPPENHEIMER: Can you run the calculations
yourself?
EINSTEIN: About the only thing you and I
share is a disdain for mathematics.
Who’s working on it at Berkeley?
OPPENHEIMER: Hans Bethe.
EINSTEIN: He’ll get to the truth.
OPPENHEIMER: And if the truth is catastrophic?
EINSTEIN: Then you stop. And share your
findings with the Nazis, so neither
side destroys the world.
I turn to leave.
EINSTEIN (CONT’D): Robert?
(holding out paper)
This is yours. Not mine.

INT. CORRIDOR, BERKELEY -- DAY

I come past the secretaries. Bethe is there, excited.
BETHE: Teller’s wrong-
I gesture SILENCE as I unlock the Rad Lab-

INT. RAD LAB, BERKELEY -- CONTINUOUS

Bethe runs to the cabinet- takes out some papers- hands them
to me, excited. I start to scan them, GRINNING-
BETHE: When you narrow Teller’s critical
assumptions the real picture
emerges-
OPPENHEIMER: Bottom line?

63.

64.
BETHE: The chances of an uncontrolled
nuclear reaction are near zero.
OPPENHEIMER: Near zero?
BETHE: Oppie, this is good news-
OPPENHEIMER: Can you run more calculations?
BETHE: You’ll get the same answer. Until
we actually detonate one of these
things, the best assurance you’re
going to get is this-
(jabs paper)
Near zero.
OPPENHEIMER: Theory will take you only so far.

INT. OPPENHEIMER HOUSE, BERKELEY -- NIGHT

Kitty opens the door to the Chevaliers, finger to her lips -
I am holding the sleeping Peter.
BARBARA: (whispering)
So beautiful. We miss him.
KITTY: Want to adopt?
OPPENHEIMER: She’s kidding.
Kitty shakes her head, 'not kidding'. Barbara takes Peter. I
lead Chevalier to the kitchen...
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): We wanted to see you before we
left.
CHEVALIER: For parts unknown...

INT. KITCHEN, OPPENHEIMER HOUSE, BERKELEY -- CONTINUOUS

I mix a tray of martinis. Chevalier watches, distracted.

64.

65.
CHEVALIER: You know who I ran into the other
day? Eltenton.
OPPENHEIMER: The chemist from Shell? Union guy?
CHEVALIER: Yeah. He was moaning about the way
we’re handling the war.
OPPENHEIMER: How so?
CHEVALIER: Lack of cooperation with our
allies. Apparently, our government
isn’t sharing any research with the
Russians. He said a lot of
scientists think the policy’s
stupid.
My hands SLOW...
OPPENHEIMER: Oh, yeah?
CHEVALIER: Yeah. He mentioned that if anyone
had information they wanted to pass
on, going around official channels,
he could help...
I look up at Chevalier. Grave.
OPPENHEIMER: That would be treason.
CHEVALIER: Yes, of course. I just thought you
should know.
We STARE at each other... BANG- Kitty barges in.
KITTY: Brat’s down- where are the
martinis?
She sees us having a moment...
OPPENHEIMER (V.O.): The discussion ended there.
I pick up the tray.

65.

66.

INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY

OPPENHEIMER: Nothing in our long-standing
friendship would have led me to
believe that Chevalier was actually
seeking information; and I was
certain he had no idea of the work
on which I was engaged.
I steal a glance at Robb, then look directly at the board-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): It has long been clear to me that I
should have reported this incident
at once.
SENATOR MCGEE (V.O.): The Oppenheimer situation
highlights the tension between
scientists and the security

INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W)

Strauss is at the witness table facing the Senate Committee.
SENATOR MCGEE: In hopes of learning how the
nominee handled such issues during
his time at the AEC, we’ll have a
scientist appearing before the
Committee.
STRAUSS: (private)
Who’re they bringing in?
COUNSEL: (private)
They haven’t said.
STRAUSS: Mr Chairman, if I may? I’m
nominated for Commerce Secretary.
Why seek the opinion of scientists-
CHAIRMAN: This is a Cabinet post, Admiral. We
seek a wide range of opinion.

66.

67.
STRAUSS: I’d like to know the name of the
scientist testifying. And I’d like
the chance to cross-examine.
CHAIRMAN: (irritated)
This is not a court.

INT. SENATE OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER (B&W)

The Senate Aide shows Strauss and Counsel in.
COUNSEL: Lewis, you’re not on trial-
STRAUSS: So everyone keeps saying.
COUNSEL: You act like a defence attorney,
the Committee’s gonna act like a
prosecutor.
STRAUSS: (to Senate Aide)
A formality, huh?
SENATE AIDE: No Presidential Cabinet nominee has
failed to be confirmed since 1925.
This is just how the game is
played.
COUNSEL: It’s in the bag, Lewis, so play
nice. They bring in a scientist, so
what?
Strauss gives a wry smile. Remembers-
INSERT CUT: STRAUSS APPROACHES EINSTEIN AND OPPENHEIMER-
EINSTEIN BLOWS PAST WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING STRAUSS...
STRAUSS: You don’t know scientists like I
do, counselor. They resent anyone
who questions their judgement-
especially if you’re not one of
them...

68.
INSERT CUT: STRAUSS STARES- THE CROWD AT THE ISOTOPES HEARING
LAUGHS...:
STRAUSS (CONT’D): I was chair of the AEC- I’m easy to
blame for what happened to Robert.
SENATE AIDE: We can’t let the Senate think that
the scientific community doesn’t
support you.
STRAUSS: Should we pivot?
SENATE AIDE: To what?
STRAUSS: Embrace it. 'I fought Oppenheimer
and the US won'?
SENATE AIDE: I don’t think we need to go there.
Isn’t there anyone we can call who
knows what really happened?
STRAUSS: Teller.
SENATE AIDE: He’ll make an impression.
STRAUSS: Can you find out the name of the
scientist they’ve called?
SENATE AIDE: Probably.
STRAUSS: (to Counsel)
We get that name- you call the AEC,
find out if he was based in Chicago
or Los Alamos during the war.
SENATE AIDE: Why’s that matter?
STRAUSS: If he was in Chicago he worked
under Szilard and Fermi, not the
cult of Oppie at Los Alamos.

I DRIVE Kitty and Peter through the 'town'... Kitty STARES at

KITTY: All it needs is a saloon.

INT. OPPENHEIMER HOUSE, LOS ALAMOS -- DAY

I stand in the hall, holding Peter, NERVOUS, as Kitty
inspects the house... she pokes her head back in-
KITTY: Robert. There’s no kitchen.
OPPENHEIMER: Really? We’ll fix that. Don’t

I walk Bethe through the security gate.
BETHE: Barbed wire. Guns, Oppie.
OPPENHEIMER: We’re at war, Hans.

INT. LECTURE HALL, T-SECTION, LOS ALAMOS -- DAY

I step up to join Serber- throw up a slide. Condon,
Neddermeyer, Kistiakowsky, Donald, Tolman, Bainbridge and
Feynman, amongst other SCIENTISTS, are in attendance.
OPPENHEIMER: Halifax, 1917. A cargo ship
carrying munitions exploded in the
harbor...
STRAUSS (CONT’D):

70.
INSERT CUT: WOOD AND CONCRETE FRAGMENTS FLY...
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): A vast and sudden chemical
reaction...
INSERT CUT: A SHOCKWAVE DRIFTS ACROSS THE TOPS OF THE CHOPPY
WATER...:
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): The biggest man-made explosion in
history. Let’s calculate how much
more destructive it would have been
with a nuclear, not chemical,
reaction. Expressing power in terms
of tons of TNT-
BETHE: But it’ll be thousands.
OPPENHEIMER: Then, kilotons.
I switch the lights on, step down to let Serber-
SERBER: Using U-235, the bomb-
He sees me wave.
SERBER (CONT’D): Sorry- the gadget will need a
thirty-three-pound sphere, about
this size...
Serber reaches below the table, brings up a GOLDFISH BOWL-
SERBER (CONT’D): Or using plutonium, a ten-pound
sphere...
He puts a large BRANDY GLASS next to the aquarium.
SERBER (CONT’D): Here’s the amount of uranium Oak
Ridge refined all of last month.
Serber drops THREE MARBLES into the bowl. The scientists
stare at the almost-empty goldfish bowl.
SERBER (CONT’D): The Hanford plant made this much
plutonium...

70.

71.
He drops TWO MARBLES into the brandy glass.
SERBER (CONT’D): If we can enrich these amounts...
we need a way to detonate them.
Teller is at the back folding a paper plane.
OPPENHEIMER: Are we boring you, Edward?
TELLER: (without looking up)
Yes.
OPPENHEIMER: May I ask why?
TELLER: We came into this room knowing a
fission bomb was possible. Let’s
leave it with something new.
OPPENHEIMER: Such as?
TELLER: A 'super' atomic bomb. Instead of
uranium, or plutonium, we use
hydrogen.
MURMURS of dissent-
TELLER (CONT’D): (shutting them down)
Heavy hydrogen- deuterium. We
compact the atoms together under
great force and induce a fusion
reaction. Not kilotons... megatons.
A HUBBUB develops- I process quickly, then-
OPPENHEIMER: Hang on. How do you generate enough
force to fuse hydrogen atoms?
Teller smiles a self-satisfied smile.
TELLER: A small fission bomb.
GROANS all around...

71.

72.
OPPENHEIMER: Well, since you’re going to need
one, anyway... can we get back to
the business at hand?
Teller SHRUGS.

INT. SENATE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM -- DAY (B&W)

SENATOR BARTLETT: Mr Strauss, the isotopes issue
wasn’t your most important policy
disagreement with Dr Oppenheimer.
It was the Hydrogen bomb, wasn’t
it?
STRAUSS: We did disagree about the need for
an H-bomb programme.
SENATOR BARTLETT: Tell us how that came to pass.

Strauss enters- a table surrounded by AEC members-
Oppenheimer is slouched at the table, pipe blazing, Bush
presides... Strauss removes his overcoat, revealing a
tuxedo...
STRAUSS: What do we know?
BUSH: One of our B-29s over the north
Pacific picked up radiation.
Rabi uses a compass to indicate an area on the map...

72.

73.
STRAUSS: Do you have the filter papers?
OPPENHEIMER: There’s no doubt what this is.
STRAUSS: The White House says there’s doubt.
Oppenheimer begrudgingly slides them over to Strauss.
BUSH: Wishful thinking, I’m afraid.
OPPENHEIMER: It’s an atomic test.
STRAUSS: The Soviets have a bomb? We’re
supposed to be years ahead of them.
What were you guys doing at Los
Alamos? Wasn’t the security tight?
OPPENHEIMER: Of course it was- you weren’t
there, Lewis.
NICHOLS (O.S.): Forgive me, doctor...
Strauss leans around the FLOWERS in the centre of the table

SCIENTISTS emerge. A THIN YOUNG MAN offers his hand-
FUCHS: (German accent)
Dr Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.
OPPENHEIMER: How long have you been British?
FUCHS: Since Hitler told me I wasn’t
German.

INT. LECTURE HALL, T-SECTION, LOS ALAMOS -- DAY

Bethe, Teller, Condon, Kistiakowsky, Donald, Bainbridge,
Fuchs and Feynman and other scientists listen to-
SERBER: I call it 'shooting'- we fire a

the larger sphere with enough force
to achieve criticality.
INSERT CUT: A URANIUM "BULLET" IS FIRED INTO A SPHERE-
TOLMAN: I’ve been thinking about implosion.
Explosives around the sphere blast
inwards, crushing the material.

NEDDERMEYER: I’d like to investigate that idea.
OPPENHEIMER: I’ll talk to the Ordinance division-
we’ll get you blowing things up...

Groves notices the YOUNG WOMAN working behind the desk-

INT. OPPENHEIMER’S OFFICE, LOS ALAMOS -- CONTINUOUS

I slump into my chair. Groves is perplexed-
GROVES: Is that...?
OPPENHEIMER: Mrs Serber. I’ve offered jobs to
all the wives. Admin, librarians,
computation. We cut down on staff
and keep families together.
GROVES: Are these women qualified?
OPPENHEIMER: Don’t be absurd. These are some of
the brightest minds in our
community.
CONDON: And they’re already security
cleared.
NICHOLS: I’ve informed General Groves you’ve
been holding cross-divisional open
discussions-
GROVES: Shut ’em down.
Compartmentalization is the
key to maintaining security-
CONDON: It’s only the top men.
NICHOLS: Who, presumably, communicate with
subordinates.
OPPENHEIMER: These men aren’t stupid, they can
be discreet.
GROVES: I don’t like it.
OPPENHEIMER: You don’t like anything enough for
there to be a fair test.

75.

Groves shrugs. Gets up to leave. Nichols rolls his eyes.
GROVES: Once a week. Top men only.
OPPENHEIMER: I’d like to bring my brother here.
GROVES: No.
Groves and Condon leave- I corner Nichols-
OPPENHEIMER: I still haven’t heard that my
security clearance has been
approved.
NICHOLS: It hasn’t.
OPPENHEIMER: We’re going to Chicago tomorrow-
NICHOLS: You should wait.
OPPENHEIMER: You’re aware that the Nazis have a
two-year head start?
NICHOLS: Dr Oppenheimer, the fact that your
security clearance is proving
difficult to obtain is not my
fault. It’s yours.
OPPENHEIMER: It may not be your fault, but it’s
your problem. Because I’m going.

NICHOLS: Too many. Compartmentalization was
supposed to be the protocol.
OPPENHEIMER: We were in a race against the Nazis-
STRAUSS: Well, now the race is against the
Soviets.
OPPENHEIMER: Only if we start it.
Strauss holds up the filter papers.
STRAUSS: Robert, they just fired the
starting gun. What’s the nature of
the device they detonated?
OPPENHEIMER: The data indicates it may have been
a plutonium implosion device.
STRAUSS: Like the one you built at Los
Alamos?
Oppenheimer nods reluctantly...
STRAUSS (CONT’D): If the Soviets have a bomb, Truman
needs to know what’s next.
Bush nods. Oppenheimer looks incredulous-
OPPENHEIMER: What’s next? Arms talks. Obviously.
STRAUSS: (to Bush)
What about the Super? Does Truman
even know about it?
BUSH: Not specifically.
OPPENHEIMER: We still don’t know if a Hydrogen
bomb is technically feasible.

77.

78.
STRAUSS: My understanding is that Teller
first proposed it at Los Alamos.
OPPENHEIMER: His designs have always been wildly
impractical. You’d have to deliver
by ox-cart not airplane.
STRAUSS: If it could put us ahead again,
Truman needs to know about it. And
if there’s a possibility that the
Russians know about it from a spy
at Los Alamos... we’ve gotta get
going.
OPPENHEIMER: There’s no proof there was a spy at
Los Alamos.

You know what, Generalissimo? I
quit.

Thanks for nothing.
Condon storms out. Groves turns to me.

humble soldier.
OPPENHEIMER: You’re neither humble, nor 'just' a

perhaps you’ll get me my security
clearance, so I can perform this

General Groves looks at me. Nods.
GARRISON (V.O.): General Groves, were you aware of
Dr Oppenheimer’s left-wing
associations when you appointed
him?

INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY

Groves, in CIVILIAN CLOTHES, testifies. I watch...
GROVES: I was aware that there were

GARRISON: In your opinion, would he ever
consciously commit a disloyal act?
GROVES: I would be amazed if he did.

GARRISON: You had complete confidence in his
integrity?
GROVES: At Los Alamos, yes, which is where
I really knew him.
ROBB: General, did your security officers
on the project advise against the
clearance of Dr Oppenheimer?
GROVES: Truer to say they could not and
would not clear him. Until I
insisted...
ROBB: You became pretty familiar with the
security file on Dr Oppenheimer?
GROVES: I did.
ROBB: General, there’s really only one
question we need answered here

full goldfish bowl, then ADDS TWO MORE- the room APPLAUDS.
Oppenheimer BOWS, steps down. Lawrence BOUNCES up-

OPPENHEIMER: He’d left the Party by then.
STRAUSS: And Lomanitz?
OPPENHEIMER: He was never employed at Los
Alamos, he was a liaison. Our

Colonel Nichols well knows.
NICHOLS: Our security was the tightest we

Alone on the couch, I glance up, NERVOUS, as a man in uniform
walks past. As he sits, I study the back of his head.
ROBB: Colonel Pash, can you read from
your memo of June 29th, 1943?

91.

92.
PASH: 'Results of surveillance conducted
on subject indicate further
possible Communist Party
connections. Subject met with and
spent considerable time with one
Jean Tatlock, Communist, the record
of whom is attached.'
ROBB: The subject being Dr Oppenheimer?
PASH: Yes.
ROBB: Whom you had not met?
PASH: Not then, but soon after...

INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO CHICAGO -- DAY

OPPENHEIMER: He’s head of security for the
project, shouldn’t I know him?
GROVES: No, he should know you. I’d never
put you in a room with Pash.
OPPENHEIMER: Why not?
GROVES: When Pash first learned about
Lomanitz- he told the FBI he was
going to kidnap him, take him out
on a boat, interrogate him 'in the
Russian manner'...

INT. LT. JOHNSON’S OFFICE -- DAY

Pash sits down next to me, opposite Johnson.

PASH: Dr Oppenheimer, this is a pleasure.
General Groves has placed a certain
responsibility in me, and it’s like
having a child, that you can’t see,
by remote control, so to actually
meet you... I don’t mean to take
much of your time...
The disarming friendliness of the truly dangerous.
OPPENHEIMER: Not at all. Whatever time you
choose.
PASH: Mr Johnson told me of your
conversation yesterday, in which
I’m very interested. It had me
worried all day...
OPPENHEIMER: I didn’t want to talk to Lomanitz
without authorization-
PASH: That’s not the particular interest
I have. It’s something a little
more, in my opinion, more
serious...

INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO CHICAGO -- DAY

GROVES: When the FBI pointed out that such
information couldn’t be used in
court Pash made it clear that he
didn’t intend to have anyone left
to prosecute. The FBI talked him
down, but that’s the man you’re
dancing with.

INT. LT. JOHNSON’S OFFICE -- DAY

PASH: I gather you’ve heard there are
other parties interested in the
work of the Radiation Lab...

93.

94.
OPPENHEIMER: Well, a man attached to the Soviet
Consul indicated, through
intermediate people, to people on
this project that he was in a
position to transmit information
they might supply.
PASH: Why would anyone on the project
want that?
OPPENHEIMER: Frankly, I can see there might be
arguments for the commander-in-
chief informing the Russians-
they’re our allies. But I don’t
like the idea of it going out the
back door- it might not hurt to be
on the lookout for it.

INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO CHICAGO -- DAY

GROVES: You said that to Pash?
OPPENHEIMER: I was trying to put it in the
context of... Russia’s not Germany.
GROVES: Boris Pash is the son of a Russian
Orthodox bishop. Born here but in
1918 he went back to Russia to
fight the Bolsheviks. This is a man
who’s killed Communists with his
own hands.

INT. LT. JOHNSON’S OFFICE -- DAY

Pash spreads his palms...
PASH: I’m not the judge of who should or
should not get information. My
business is to stop it going
through illegally. Could you be a
little more specific?

94.
8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904

95.
OPPENHEIMER: There’s a man whose name was
mentioned to me a couple of times-
Eltenton. I think he’s a chemist
employed by Shell. He talked to a
friend of his who’s an acquaintance
of someone on the project. To go
beyond that would be to put names
down of people who are not only
innocent but were one hundred
percent cooperative.

INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO CHICAGO -- DAY

Groves is staring at me like I just crapped my pants.
GROVES: You thought Pash would be satisfied
with that?
OPPENHEIMER: I was trying to give them Eltenton
without opening a can of worms. I
told him a cock-and-bull story.

INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY

I am up front. Robb questioning-
ROBB: Did you lie to General Groves, too?
OPPENHEIMER: No, I told him I’d lied to Pash.

INT. SAME -- DAY

Groves is on the stand, in civilian clothes-
GARRISON: Do you recall your conversation
with him about the Chevalier
incident?
GROVES: I’ve seen so many versions of it, I
wasn’t confused before, but I’m
certainly getting there now.
GARRISON: What was your conclusion?

95.

96.
GROVES: That he was under the influence of
the typical American schoolboy
attitude that there’s something
wicked about telling on a friend.
He did what he thought was
essential- disclosing Eltenton.

INT. SAME -- DAY

Pash is testifying.
PASH: The memo I wrote at the time states
'Dr Oppenheimer sought to provide
information to burnish his image as
loyal, clearly having heard of our
investigation at Berkeley. He is
not to be trusted on matters of
security.'

INT. LT. JOHNSON’S OFFICE -- DAY

Pash gazes, unblinking, into my eyes...
PASH: These other people you mentioned,
were they contacted by Eltenton
direct?
OPPENHEIMER: No.
PASH: Well now, could we know through
whom that contact was made?
OPPENHEIMER: It would involve people who ought
not be involved in this.
PASH: Is this person a member of the
project?
OPPENHEIMER: A member of the faculty, but not on
the project.

96.
8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904

97.
PASH: Eltenton made the approach through
a member of the faculty here at
Berkeley?
OPPENHEIMER: As far as I know- there may have
been more than one person involved.
If I seem uncooperative I think you
can understand that it’s because of
my insistence in not getting
innocent people into trouble.
Pash stares at me. I finally keep my mouth shut.
PASH: You see me as persistent-
OPPENHEIMER: You are persistent, and that is
your job. But my job is protecting
the people who work for me.
PASH: Instead of us going on certain
steps which may come to your
attention and be a little bit...
disturbing to you... I’d rather
discuss those with you first. I’m
not formulating any plans, I’m just
going to have to digest the whole
thing.
I nod at Pash. Get to my feet.

INT. TRAIN, SANTA FE TO CHICAGO -- DAY

Groves takes in the story.
GROVES: You’re protecting a friend. But
who’s protecting you?
OPPENHEIMER: You could.
GROVES: If you gave me the name.
OPPENHEIMER: If you order me to, I’ll do it.

97.

98.
GROVES: You’re making a mistake, Robert. A
mistake that may haunt you. You
need to volunteer this name.
I turn to watch the scenery trundle past.
ROBB (V.O.): And did he give you the name?

INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY

GROVES: He did.
ROBB: But not at that time.
GROVES: No.
ROBB: In fact, it was some months later,
wasn’t it?
Groves nods.

INT. SAME -- DAY

I study the back of Boris Pash’s head...
ROBB: And in the months between your
interview with Dr Oppenheimer and
his eventual naming of Chevalier,
did you expend resources trying to
find the identity of the
intermediary?
PASH: Considerable resources. Without the
name our job was extremely
difficult.
ROBB: When did you receive the name?
PASH: I was gone by the time Oppenheimer
offered it up.

98.
8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904

99.
ROBB: Gone?
PASH: They felt my time would be better
spent in Europe determining the
status of the Nazi bomb project.
ROBB: Who did?
PASH: General Groves. He transferred me
to London.
I lift my head at this.

Serber and I walk down the street. Snow falling.
SERBER: Little early for a Christmas party.
OPPENHEIMER: Something’s up. Tolman’s been away.
SERBER: Where?
OPPENHEIMER: Ruth won’t tell.
We head towards Fuller Lodge...

INT. FULLER LODGE, LOS ALAMOS -- LATER

A CHRISTMAS PARTY. DEBAUCHED. Kitty, in SANTA HAT,
serves/spikes the EGGNOG. Bethe, Teller, Charlotte Serber,
Neddermeyer, Kistiakowsky, Donald, Hornig, Bainbridge, Fuchs,
Feynman amongst the revelers. I have Ruth cornered, glancing
over at Kitty, who pretends she wasn’t looking at me and
GRABS at the nearest male arm- pushing eggnog...
RUTH: Compartmentalization, Oppie. What
makes you think I know, anyway?

99.

I take her glass. Sip from it...
OPPENHEIMER: You do a good job of knowing where
Mr Tolman is... when it counts.
RUTH: Like now.
I turn- Tolman and Groves enter, brushing off snow...
GROVES: Atten-shun! We have an early
Christmas present for you...
They step aside to reveal... NIELS BOHR. I grin.
BOHR (V.O.): The British pilots put me in the
bomb bay...

INT. SAME -- LATER

Bohr holds court. I listen at the back.
BOHR: ...showed me the oxygen- of course
I messed it up. When they opened me
up in Scotland I was unconscious. I
pretended I’d been napping.
The crowd LAUGHS, loving it. Bohr peels off to talk to me.
BOHR (CONT’D): Is it big enough?
OPPENHEIMER: To end the war?
BOHR: To end all war.

INT. LECTURE HALL, T-SECTION -- LATER

I sip my drink, watching Bohr read the boards. Tolman,
Teller, Bethe and Serber sprawl, party hats, TINSEL

BOHR: Heisenberg sought me out in
Copenhagen. It was chilling- my old

He told me things to draw me out...
sustained fission reactions in
uranium...
TOLMAN: That sounds more like a reactor
than a bomb.
TELLER: Did he mention gaseous diffusion?
BOHR: He seemed more focused on heavy
water.
TELLER: As a moderator?
BOHR: Yes. Instead of graphite.
Serber and Tolman GRIN. I nod. Bohr notices us relax...
BOHR (CONT’D): What?
OPPENHEIMER: He took a wrong turn. We’re ahead.
And with you here to help us...
Bohr turns to Teller and the others-
BOHR: Gentlemen, could you give us a
moment?
They shuffle out. Bohr looks at the MARBLES. Turns to me...
BOHR (CONT’D): I’m not here to help, Robert. I
knew you could do this without me.
OPPENHEIMER: Then why did you come?
BOHR: To talk about after. The power
you’re revealing will forever
outlive the Nazis. And the world is
not prepared.
BOHR (CONT’D):

101.

102.
OPPENHEIMER: You can lift the rock without being
ready for the snake that’s
revealed.
BOHR: We have to make the politicians
understand- this isn’t a new weapon-
it’s a new world. I’ll be out
there, doing what I can- but you...
(points at me)
You’re an American Prometheus-
Father of the Atomic Bomb. The man
who gave them the power to destroy
themselves. They’ll respect that.
And your work really begins.
I take this in. Charlotte Serber enters-
CHARLOTTE: I’m sorry, Oppie, but there’s a
call. From San Francisco.
I look at my watch, surprised... look at Bohr, who nods 'Go.'

NEDDERMEYER: You can’t rush everything,

KISTIAKOWSKY (CONT’D): There’s rushing and there’s

BETHE: Teller’s not helping- I’ve

TELLER: The British can do it- Fuchs-
FUCHS: Absolutely.
BETHE: It’s your job, Teller!
TELLER (CONT’D): I’m engaged in research-

Teller simply walks away. As he passes me-

Teller is held at the gate. I approach. We face off in the

OPPENHEIMER: I won’t let you leave. Forget Hans,

research what you want. Fusion. The
Hydrogen bomb- whatever. We’ll meet

TELLER: You don’t have time to meet. You’re

physics behind long ago.
OPPENHEIMER: Once a week. One hour, you and me.
Teller considers this. Nods, turns to the GUARD-
TELLER: Now, raise that fucking barrier.
ROBB (O.S.): So the Super was under development
on your watch at Los Alamos...

INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY

OPPENHEIMER (V.O.): ...about the best response.
BUSH: Truman has to do something...
Rabi opens his compasses wider...
RABI: An H-bomb would be one thousand
times the power of an A-bomb.
He draws a circle around Moscow...
RABI (CONT’D): The only intended target would be
the largest cities.
And a circle around St Petersburg...
RABI (CONT’D): It’s a weapon of mass genocide.

STRAUSS: Deterrence.
BUSH: Do we need more deterrence than our
current arsenal of atomic bombs?

technical one. Robert?
I JAM my eyes CLOSED, SHAKE OFF the image- the sound STOPS-
OPPENHEIMER: Teller’s designs are as impractical
as they were during the war.
LAWRENCE: The Hydrogen bomb can be made to
work, Oppie. You know that.
OPPENHEIMER: We can’t commit all our resources
to that chance.
STRAUSS: Then how would you have Truman
reassure the American people?

107.

108.
OPPENHEIMER: By limiting the spread of atomic
weapons through international
control of nuclear energy.
STRAUSS: World government?
OPPENHEIMER: The United Nations. As Roosevelt
intended.
STRAUSS: I asked what Truman should do. The
world’s changed. Communism
threatens our survival.
OPPENHEIMER: Lewis, if we build a Hydrogen bomb,
the Soviets would have no choice
but to build their own.
STRAUSS: Could they be working on it
already? Based on information from
a spy at Los Alamos?
OPPENHEIMER: There was no spy at Los
Alamos!
BUSH: Gentlemen, let’s not get
sidetracked.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): I say we use this moment to gain
concessions from the Russians by
committing that we will not build
the Hydrogen bomb.
STRAUSS: Thereby revealing its existence.
OPPENHEIMER: Which you seem convinced they
already know.
BUSH: At this point I’d like the Advisory

Borden approaches.
BORDEN: Dr Oppenheimer? William Borden-
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.

OPPENHEIMER: If we both speak, they listen to

great salesman of science-
you can convince anyone of
anything. Even yourself.

INT. SECRETARY OF WAR’S OFFICE -- DAY

I sit on a couch next to Fermi- Lawrence, Groves and Bush in
chairs. Secretary of War STIMSON presides. Military,
scientists and officials are scattered through the room.
STIMSON: The firestorm in Tokyo killed one
hundred thousand people. Mostly
civilians. I worry about an America
where we do these things and no one
protests.
MARSHALL: Pearl Harbor and three years of
brutal conflict in the Pacific buys
a lot of latitude with the American
public.
STIMSON: Enough to unleash the atomic bomb?
FERMI: In truth, the A-bomb might not
cause as much damage as the Tokyo
bombings.
STIMSON: What are we estimating?
BUSH: In a medium-sized city, twenty or
thirty thousand dead.

117.
OPPENHEIMER: Don’t underestimate the
psychological impact of an atomic
explosion... a pillar of fire ten
thousand feet tall, deadly neutron
effects for a mile in all
directions... from one. Single.
Device. Dropped from a barely
noticed B-29... the atomic bomb
will be a terrible revelation of
divine power.
Groves carefully monitors my effect on the room...
MARSHALL: If that’s true it would be
definitive. World War II would be
over. Our boys would come home.
STIMSON: This could end the war.
OPPENHEIMER: This could end all war. If we
retain moral advantage.
Groves registers the pivot...
STIMSON: How so?
OPPENHEIMER: If we use this weapon without
informing our allies, they’ll see
It as a threat and we’ll be in an
arms race.
MARSHALL: How open can we be with the
Soviets?
BUSH: Secrecy won’t stop the Soviets
becoming part of the atomic world.
A politician, BYRNES, clears his throat politely-
BYRNES: We’ve been told they have no
uranium.
BUSH: You’ve been misinformed. A Russian
bomb is a matter of time.

117.

118.
LAWRENCE: To stay ahead, our programme has to
continue at full pace after the
war.
OPPENHEIMER: Secretary Stimson, if I may. Not
all the scientists on the project
agree. In fact, this might be a
moment to consider other opinions-
GROVES: The Manhattan Project’s been
plagued from the start by certain
scientists of doubtful discretion
and uncertain loyalty. One of them
just tried to get a meeting with
the President.
I say nothing. Groves looks directly at me.
GROVES (CONT’D): We need them for now, but as soon
as is practical, we should sever
any such scientists from the
programme. Wouldn’t you agree,
doctor?
I meet Groves’ gaze. Stay silent... Nod.
MARSHALL: If a Russian bomb is inevitable,
perhaps we should invite their top
scientists to Trinity.
BYRNES: President Truman has no intention
of raising expectations that Stalin
be included in the atomic project.
STIMSON: Informing him of our breakthrough,
and presenting it as the means to
win the war need not make
unkeepable promises. But the
Potsdam peace conference in July is
the last chance for Truman to have
that conversation. Can you give us
a working bomb by then?
GROVES: Absolutely. We’ll test-fire before
the conference.

118.
8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904
(MORE):

119.
STIMSON: And Japan?
OPPENHEIMER: If the test works you’ll have two
bombs for August.
STIMSON: Military targets?
OPPENHEIMER: There aren’t any big enough.
CONANT: Perhaps a vital war plant, with
workers housed nearby.
FERMI: Could we issue a warning? To reduce
civilian casualties.
AIR FORCE OFFICER: They’d send up everything they have
against us, and I’d be in that
plane.
BUSH: If we announce it and it fails to
go off we’d scupper any chance of
Japanese surrender.
LAWRENCE: Is there no way to demonstrate the
bomb to Japan to provoke surrender?
GROVES: We intend to demonstrate it in the
most unambiguous terms. Twice. Once
to show the weapon’s power. A
second to show that we can keep
going until they surrender.
STIMSON: We have a list of twelve cities to
choose from. Sorry, eleven, I’ve
taken Kyoto off the list because of
its cultural significance to the
Japanese people.
Stimson senses the unease in the room...
STIMSON (CONT’D): Let me make this simple for you,
gentlemen.
(MORE):

119.
STIMSON (CONT’D):

120.
The Japanese will not surrender
short of a successful invasion of
the home islands. Many lives,
American and Japanese, will be lost
in that invasion. The use of the
atomic bomb against Japanese cities
will save lives.

EXT. BASE OF STEEL TOWER, TRINITY TEST SITE -- DAY

Frank shows Groves and me the site plan...
FRANK: Ground Zero. Observation posts at
ten thousand yards north, south and
west.
OPPENHEIMER: Where do we trigger from?
FRANK: South ten thousand. Base camp is
ten miles south, here. And a
further observation point on this
hill twenty miles away.
I point to a crew digging a trench from the base of the
tower.
OPPENHEIMER: What’s that? The trigger lines went
in already.
FRANK: The air force requested a line of
lights for their B-29.
GROVES: What B-29? Our bomb’s on the tower.
FRANK: They want to use the test to
confirm the safe operating
distance.
OPPENHEIMER: Risky.
FRANK: Not as risky as dropping one over
Japan and hoping we were right
about the blast radius.
STIMSON (CONT’D):

120.
8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904

121.
OPPENHEIMER: Don’t let them slow us down- we’re
firing on the 15th.
FRANK: The 15th?! That’s not-
GROVES: The 15th!
Frank sees my expression-
FRANK (CONT’D): The 15th.

INT. LECTURE HALL, T-SECTION, LOS ALAMOS -- DAY

I show the plan to the division heads.
OPPENHEIMER: I’ll be at the south observation
point with Frank and Kistiakowsky.
You’ll all be assigned to base
camp, far observation, or west
observation.
INSERT CUT: I ENTER A TENT AT THE BASE OF THE TOWER- THE
SILVER SPHERE OF THE BOMB IS SURROUNDED BY THE TEAM...
BETHE: Are those safe distances?
OPPENHEIMER: They’re based on your calculations.
RABI: Time to stand behind your science,
Hans. Literally.
INSERT CUT: THE BOMB IS HOISTED UP IN TO THE TOWER...
TELLER: What about the radiation cloud?
OPPENHEIMER: Without high winds it should settle
within two to three miles.
Evacuation measures will be in
place, but we need good weather for
visibility so it should be fine. We
go on the night of the 15th.

121.

122.
The team exchange looks-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): That’s a hard deadline, so if
anyone has anything... speak now.
BETHE: We need a final implosion test.
KISTIAKOWSKY: Couldn’t hurt.
OPPENHEIMER: Do it. Is there anything else that
might stop us?
A THUNDERCLAP takes us into-

EXT. OPPENHEIMER HOUSE, LOS ALAMOS -- DAY

White sheets FLAP CRAZILY in the wind... through the window
we see Kitty put her drink down reluctantly. She comes out to
grab a sheet that has come loose from the line... notices a
JEEP idling at the gate, ARMED GUARDS patiently waiting.
I emerge from the house carrying an overnight bag. Kitty, one
hand on the washing line, turns to look at me, curious.
KITTY: It’s happening, isn’t it?
I watch the sheets flapping. Glance at the guards...
OPPENHEIMER: I’ll send a message. If it’s gone
our way... 'Take in the sheets.'
She nods. I head towards the waiting jeep.
KITTY: Robert?
I turn, looking at Kitty amongst the FLAPPING SHEETS...
KITTY (CONT’D): Break a leg.

EXT. CANYON, LOS ALAMOS -- DAY

A BANG as the final implosion test goes off... Kistiakowsky
and Fuchs raise their heads... Kistiakowsky shows Fuchs the
tape, grave.

EXT. STEEL TOWER, TRINITY TEST SITE -- EVENING

I watch the last TECHNICIAN come down. I nod at the man, then
start my lonely climb... I stare at the silver sphere of the
first atomic bomb, its surface STUDDED with detonators, WIRES
DRAPED across it like spaghetti. Thunder RUMBLES. I watch the
approaching storm...

EXT. BASE CAMP, TRINITY TEST SITE -- EVENING

Army tents. A WINDMILL SPINS FURIOUSLY...

INT. BASE CAMP, TRINITY TEST SITE -- EVENING

Fermi moves through the team, taking bets...
FERMI: Oppie’s taken a very modest three
kilotons... Teller’s in for forty-
five...
Rabi pulls out some bills-
RABI: Twenty.
FERMI: Twenty thousand tons of TNT... and
does anyone want the side action on
total atmospheric ignition?
The scientists groan and laugh. Soldiers look at each other: 'What the hell?' Groves corners the army WEATHERMAN.
GROVES: Are you saying we’ll have to delay?
WEATHERMAN: I’m saying it would be prudent.
OPPENHEIMER: Has this weather reached the site?
The weatherman gets on his radio. Kistiakowsky BURSTS in-
KISTIAKOWSKY: Oppie-
The phone rings -

123.

124.
KISTIAKOWSKY (CONT’D): Bethe’s calling you to tell you the
implosion test failed, but-
I have the phone to my ear -
OPPENHEIMER: Hans. Yes, he’s here. Yes.
(I hang up)
Is he wrong?
KISTIAKOWSKY: No.
OPPENHEIMER: So we’re about to fire a dud?
KISTIAKOWSKY: No.
GROVES: Explain.
KISTIAKOWSKY: I can’t. I just know the implosion
lenses will work.
OPPENHEIMER: If we fire those detonators and
they don’t trigger the reaction,
two years’ worth of plutonium will
be scattered across white sands.
KISTIAKOWSKY: (holds out his hand)
A month of my salary against ten
bucks says it lights.
I study Kistiakowsky. Take the bet.
WEATHERMAN: The wind’s picking up at Zero, not
the rain. Lightning circling.
THUNDER. Rabi calls over-
RABI: Hey, weatherman, you think it might
be time to get your men away from
the steel tower with the atomic
bomb primed to detonate via
electrical charge?
The weatherman laughs. Then GRABS the radio -

124.
8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904

WEATHERMAN: Pull ’em out.
OPPENHEIMER: (to Groves)
Let’s get to south observation.
Make our determination there.

EXT. STEEL TOWER, TRINITY TEST SITE -- NIGHT

The last trucks drive away, lightning on the horizon. The
bomb sits there, impervious to peals of DRY THUNDER...

EXT. SOUTH OBSERVATION POST, TRINITY TEST SITE -- NIGHT

Groves, the weatherman and I watch rain LASH the desert...
OPPENHEIMER: The team hasn’t slept for two
nights. We stand down, make the
bomb safe, it’s weeks before we get
back here.
GROVES: Then we miss Potsdam.
(checks watch)
I need to get word to Truman by
seven.
(to the weatherman)
Our window’s closing. What’s it
doing?
WEATHERMAN: Raining. Blowing. Lightning.
GROVES: For how long, dammit?!
WEATHERMAN: It’s holding strong.
OPPENHEIMER: It’ll break before dawn.
GROVES: How could you know that?
OPPENHEIMER: I know this desert. The air cools
overnight. Just before dawn, the
storm breaks.

125.

126.
WEATHERMAN: He could be right. But schedule it
as late as possible.
OPPENHEIMER: Five thirty?
Groves considers this. Turns to the weatherman.
GROVES: Sign your forecast. If you’re
wrong, I’ll hang you.

INT. BUNKER, SOUTH OBSERVATION POST -- NIGHT

Groves and me, alone. Rain pelting down outside.
GROVES: Three years. Four thousand people.
Two billion dollars. If it doesn’t
go off we’re both finished.
OPPENHEIMER: I put my money on three kilotons.
Any less, they won’t get what it
is.
GROVES: What did Fermi mean by 'atmospheric
ignition'?
OPPENHEIMER: We had a moment where it looked
like the chain reaction from an
atomic device might never stop.
Setting fire to the atmosphere.
GROVES: Why’s Fermi still taking side bets
on it?
OPPENHEIMER: Call it gallows humour.
Groves takes this in. Picks the scab-
GROVES: Are we saying there’s a chance that
when we push that button... we
destroy the world?

126.
8FLiX.com FYC SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230904

127.
OPPENHEIMER: Nothing in our research over the
last three years supports that
conclusion except as the most
remote possibility.
GROVES: How remote?
OPPENHEIMER: The chances are near zero.
GROVES: Near zero?
OPPENHEIMER: (smiling)
What do you want from theory alone?
GROVES: Zero would be nice.
I check my watch.
OPPENHEIMER: Well, in an hour and fifty-eight
minutes, we’ll know.
I listen-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): It’s letting up...

EXT. TRINITY TEST SITE -- NIGHT

Searchlights settle on the gleaming steel tower. A line of
lights leading from the blackness of the night-time desert to
the tower comes on...

EXT. SOUTH OBSERVATION POST, TRINITY TEST SITE -- CONTINUOUS

Groves and I come out into gentle rain. The wind has fallen
off. Frank comes up to meet us.
FRANK: The arming party’s left Zero,
heading this way, throwing the

(to the soldiers)
Turn the cars, ready for emergency
evacuation...

127.

Feynman TAPS the windshield-
FEYNMAN: The glass stops the UV.
Teller, in dark glasses, is APPLYING SUNSCREEN at night-
TELLER: But what stops the glass?
Feynman looks at Teller. Looks at the glass, shakes his head,
grinning...

INT. SOUTH OBSERVATION POST, TRINITY TEST SITE -- CONTINUOUS

Groves moves to me-
GROVES: I’m heading to base camp. Best of

Groves shakes my hand.
GROVES (CONT'D) (CONT’D): Try not to blow up the world.

INT. SAME -- MOMENTS LATER

I watch Bainbridge take his place at the KILL SWITCH.
OPPENHEIMER: Watch that needle. If the
detonators don’t charge, or if the
voltage dips below one volt, you
abort.
Bainbridge nods, watching the meter of the X-unit like a
hawk. A nervous hawk.

EXT. BASE CAMP, TRINITY TEST SITE -- CONTINUOUS

A loudspeaker broadcasts the countdown-
LOUDSPEAKER: Two minutes to detonation...
The two-minute rocket goes up-
ARMY CAPTAIN: Everybody down!

All we can hear is my TREMULOUS BREATHING as the LIGHT
becomes less BLINDING, resolving into a FIREBALL, BRIGHT AS

ROILING PLASMA become more visible in its HELLISH
CONTORTIONS... CLIMBING into the sky like the DEVIL’S CLAW...
My PUPILS are PINPRICKS-
OPPENHEIMER (V.O.): Now I am become Death, destroyer of

Kistiakowsky GRINS-
KISTIAKOWSKY: Yes, you are! Yes, you are!

EXT. BASE CAMP, TRINITY TEST SITE -- MOMENTS LATER

Rabi, still amidst the celebration, watches a car pull up.
I get out, walking like GARY FUCKING COOPER- the crowd spots

OPPENHEIMER: If they detonate it too high in the
air, the blast won’t be as powerful-
AIR FORCE OFFICER: With respect, Dr Oppenheimer. We’ll
take it from here.
I lose sight of the bomb as THE CRATE IS CLOSED.

EXT. T-SECTION, LOS ALAMOS -- DAY

Groves appears at my side, watching the loading...
OPPENHEIMER: Did Truman brief Stalin at Potsdam?
GROVES: 'Brief' would be an overstatement.
He referred to a powerful new
weapon, Stalin said he hoped we’d
make good use of it against Japan.
OPPENHEIMER: That’s it?
GROVES: Robert, we’ve given them an ace.
It’s for them to play the hand.
Frustrated, I drop my cigarette and GRIND it out-
OPPENHEIMER: You’re aiming for the 6th?
GROVES: That’s up to the CO in the Pacific.
OPPENHEIMER: Should I come with you to
Washington?
GROVES: What for?
OPPENHEIMER: Well... you’ll keep me informed?
Groves turns to leave -

GROVES: Of course.
(looks back)
As best I can.
I watch Groves leave, uneasy. A truck pulls out, REVEALING
TELLER. He crosses, watching the loaded truck move away...
TELLER: Would the Japanese surrender if
they knew what was coming?
OPPENHEIMER: I don’t know.
TELLER: Have you seen Szilard’s petition?
OPPENHEIMER: Yeah. What the hell does Szilard
know about the Japanese?
I look at Teller.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): You’re not signing it?
TELLER: A lot of people have.
OPPENHEIMER: Edward, the fact that we built this
bomb doesn’t give us any more right
or responsibility to decide how
it’s used than anyone else.
TELLER: But we’re the only people who know
about it.
OPPENHEIMER: I’ve told Stimson the various
opinions of the community.
TELLER: But what’s your opinion?
I watch another truck pull out...
OPPENHEIMER: Once it’s used, nuclear war, maybe
all war, becomes unthinkable.

Though the crowd is still CHEERING, their sound DIMINISHES...
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): But I’m sure the Japanese didn’t
like it-
CHEERS. CHEERS. CHEERS. BUT NO SOUND. As I look out at the
EXCITED FACES I can hear my own BREATHING... I carry on-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): I’m proud of what you
accomplished...
The crowd seems to go NUTS, but all we hear is the QUIET
CREAKING OF SEATS and SHUFFLE OF FEET as they REACT, HANDS
SILENTLY CLAPPING, MOUTHS SILENTLY JAWING... I try again-
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): I just wish we’d had it in time to
use against the Germans...
The CHEERING AND CLAPPING PEOPLE GET TO THEIR FEET in
MORTIFYING SILENCE...: I stare at them, straining to hear something, then-
PIERCING SCREAMS not cheers, as INSTANT DAYLIGHT POURS IN THE
WINDOWS- BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER-
My eyes are pinpricks as I see CHEERING/SCREAMING MOUTHS
STRETCHED GROTESQUELY WIDE-: CRACK!!... !!!... !!!! ... THE THUNDER OF A THOUSAND STORMS
ROLLS OVER, DEAFENING-: I see FLESH RIPPED FROM THE SMILING YOUNG FACES... I see
PLASMA ROILING and the DEVIL’S CLAW reach into the night

INT. LOBBY, OVAL OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE -- DAY

Relief. Gentle formality. I look at the coffee table: Time
magazine- me on the cover: "FATHER OF THE ATOMIC BOMB".
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.): Dr Oppenheimer?
An AIDE on softly clicking heels, points at the magazine.
AIDE: Nice picture.
I look up at her. Blank.
AIDE (CONT’D): President Truman will see you now.

INT. OVAL OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Truman comes from behind his desk to shake my hand-
TRUMAN: Dr Oppenheimer, it’s an honour.
OPPENHEIMER: Mr President. Secretary Byrnes.
Byrnes nods, sits. I take a seat. Truman leans on the desk.

141.

142.
TRUMAN: How’s it feel to be the most famous
man in the world?
I can’t think of an answer.
TRUMAN (CONT’D): You helped save a lot of
American lives. What we did
at Hiroshima was-
OPPENHEIMER: And Nagasaki.
TRUMAN (CONT’D): What?
OPPENHEIMER: Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
TRUMAN: Obviously. Your invention let us
bring our boys home.
Your country owes you a great debt.
OPPENHEIMER: It was hardly my invention.
TRUMAN: It’s you on the cover of Time.
(indicates Byrnes)
Jim here tells me you’re concerned
about an arms race with the
Soviets.
OPPENHEIMER: Well, it’s that... now is our
chance to secure international
cooperation on atomic energy, and
I’m concerned-
TRUMAN: You know when the Soviets are gonna
have a bomb?
OPPENHEIMER: I’m not sure I could give a-
TRUMAN (CONT’D): Never.
I look at the President, incredulous...
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): Mr President, the Russians have
good physicists and abundant
resources-

142.

TRUMAN: Abundant? I don’t think so.
OPPENHEIMER: They’ll put everything they have...
I taper off.
TRUMAN: I hear you’re leaving Los Alamos.
What should we do with it?
OPPENHEIMER: Give it back to the Indians.
Truman laughs. But I’m not joking. Truman looks to Byrnes for
help.
BYRNES: Dr Oppenheimer, if what you say
about the Soviets is true, we have
to build up Los Alamos, not shut it
down.
I WRING my hands, deeply uncomfortable...
OPPENHEIMER: Mr President, I feel that I have
blood on my hands.
Truman looks at me differently. Pulls the crisp white
handkerchief from his breast pocket and offers it-
TRUMAN: You think anyone in Hiroshima or
Nagasaki gives a shit who built the
bomb? They care who dropped it. I
did. Hiroshima isn’t about you.
Truman gestures to Byrnes, they both RISE. I get to my feet.
Awkward. As I leave I hear -
TRUMAN (CONT’D): Don’t let that crybaby back in
here.
The door of the Oval Office CLOSES on me...
STRAUSS (V.O.): Robert saw that hand-wringing got
him nowhere...

RUTH: I miss Richard more than I can

I turn to Ruth, sympathetic.
RUTH (CONT’D): But part of me’s glad he didn’t
live to see where this is all
going.
I nod, understanding. She downs her drink and leaves.
STRAUSS (O.S.): Robert, my son and his fiancée are
desperate to meet the father of the
atomic bomb...
Strauss is there with his adult children- I glance at them,
raise a glass, then turn away. Strauss stands there,
humiliated. The couple awkwardly moves off.
STRAUSS (CONT’D): Is this a bad time?

145.

146.
OPPENHEIMER: What do you think, Lewis?
STRAUSS: I think it must have been a blow
for you-
OPPENHEIMER: For the world.
STRAUSS: The world? What does Fuchs mean to
rest of the world?
OPPENHEIMER: Fuchs? Klaus Fuchs?
Strauss looks at me with concern...
STRAUSS: You haven’t heard. Klaus Fuchs, the
British scientist you put onto the
implosion team at Los Alamos?
INSERT CUT: FUCHS HANDS OPPENHEIMER HIS PIPE...
STRAUSS (CONT’D): Turns out he was spying for the
Soviets. The whole time. I’m sorry,
Robert, you must feel awful.

Strauss moves off. I stand there. Frozen.

could actually protect him. When
Eisenhower took over, Robert saw
one more chance. He took it...

INT. CORPORATE AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT (B&W)

Oppenheimer is lecturing... Strauss is in the crowd...
OPPENHEIMER: America and Russia may be likened
to two scorpions in a bottle, each
capable of killing the other, but
only at the risk of his own life.
There are various aspects of this
policy which I would like to
discuss but can’t. Follies that can
occur only when even the men who
know the facts can find no one to
talk about them, when the facts are
too secret for discussion, and thus
for thought. Candor is the only
remedy. Officials in Washington
have to start levelling with the
American people, and telling them
what the enemy already know about
the atomic armaments race.
Strauss notices two generals exchanging unfavorable looks.
STRAUSS (V.O.): A lot of scientists blame me, but
how was I supposed to protect him?

147.

148.

INT. SENATE OFFICE -- DAY (B&W)

STRAUSS: That was the last straw for
Robert’s enemies.
SENATE AIDE: So he had to lose his security
clearance.
STRAUSS: And with it, his credibility.
SENATE AIDE: But how could they do it? He was a
war hero- and he’d already told
everyone about his past...
STRAUSS: Borden dredged it all up again.
SENATE AIDE: But how could Borden get access to
Oppenheimer’s FBI file? Could it
have been Nichols?
STRAUSS: I can’t imagine he’d do that. But
whoever did unleashed a firestorm
that burned a path from the White
House right to my desk at the AEC.
You see them in there trying to
hang Oppenheimer around my neck.
I’ve worked my whole life to get
here- the Cabinet of the United
States of America- and now, in
front of the entire country, they
want to put me back in my place...
a lowly shoe salesman.
COUNSEL: Lewis, we can win this thing.

Serber and MORRISON lecture using slides we never see.
STRAUSS (V.O.): ...for not supporting their
petition against bombing Japan.
I watch as part of a large audience.
MORRISON: This was taken thirty-one days
after the bombing. Virtually
everyone in the street for nearly a
mile around was instantly and
seriously burned by the heat of the
bomb.
Serber changes the slide. I react slightly.
MORRISON (CONT’D): The hot flash burned suddenly and
strangely.
SERBER: The Japanese told us of people who
wore striped clothing upon whom the
skin was burned in stripes.
Changes slide. I LOOK AWAY from the screen. I hear the sound
of FEET STAMPING as Morrison continues...
MORRISON: There were many who thought
themselves lucky, who crawled out
of the ruins of their homes only
slightly injured. But they died
anyway. They died days or weeks
later from the radium-like rays
emitted in great numbers at the
moment of the explosion.

EXT. T-SECTION, LOS ALAMOS -- NIGHT

I light my pipe. Teller comes up.
TELLER: Did you read this crap in the
papers? A British physicist saying
the atomic bombings weren’t the
last act of World War II but the
first act of this cold war with
Russia.
OPPENHEIMER: Which physicist?
TELLER: I think you knew him. Patrick
Blackett?
I remember-
INSERT CUT: BLACKETT TAKES A MOUTHFUL OF APPLE...
I smile to myself, rueful...
OPPENHEIMER: He may not be wrong. We bombed an
enemy that was essentially
defeated.
TELLER: Robert, you have all the influence
now.
I look at Teller.
TELLER (CONT’D): Urge them to continue my research
on the Super.
OPPENHEIMER: I neither can nor will, Edward.
Teller looks at me. Hurt.
TELLER: Why?
OPPENHEIMER: It’s not the right use of our
resources.

will look back on your work here
with pride...

EXT. FULLER LODGE, LOS ALAMOS -- DAY

I give my leaving address, Groves by my side. The THOUSANDS
of members of the Los Alamos community listen...
OPPENHEIMER: But today that pride must be
tempered with a profound concern.
If atomic weapons are to be added
to the arsenals of a warring
world... then the day will come
when people will curse the name of
Los Alamos and Hiroshima. The
peoples of this world must unite or
they will perish. The atomic bomb
has spelled out these words for all
men to understand.
THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE echoes around the mountains...

SENATE AIDE (CONT’D): It seems pretty favorable...
The Counsel looks over Senate Aide’s shoulder-

COUNSEL: There’s Oppenheimer. What’s the
caption?
SENATE AIDE: 'J. Robert Oppenheimer- Strauss
fought him...

...and the US won.'
COUNSEL: That’ll work.
The Senate Aide is perturbed. Looks up at Strauss.
SENATE AIDE: Those are your words. From
yesterday.
STRAUSS: We needed to pivot.
SENATE AIDE: But how could you know what Time

STRAUSS: Henry Luce is an old friend.
The Senate Aide stares at Strauss, realizing...
SENATE AIDE: You’ve sat there and let me tell
you how this is done. But you’ve
been far ahead. All along...
STRAUSS: Survival in Washington is about
knowing how to get things done.

ROBB: In the years following the war,
would you say you exerted a great
influence on the atomic policies of
the USA?
OPPENHEIMER: I think 'great' would be an
overstatement.
ROBB: Really? If we look at the issue of
isotopes... were you not personally
responsible for destroying all
opposition to their export?
I think back to my congressional testimony...

INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM -- DAY

The room is all chuckles and smiles at my performance...
OPPENHEIMER: You can use a bottle of beer for
making atomic weapons, in fact, you
do... I’d say isotopes are less
useful for atomic energy than
electronic components, but more
useful than a sandwich. I’d put
them somewhere in between.
The room LAUGHS appreciatively. I lean over to Volpe -
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): How’d I do?
Volpe glances back at Lewis Strauss, eyes down, ENRAGED...

GARRISON: Rabi will help us. But it’s going

Teller-
Kitty is laughing as she opens a miniature with her teeth.
GARRISON (CONT’D): Did I say something funny?
KITTY: Borden, Borden, Borden. We all know

GARRISON: How does national security prevent
the prosecution from providing us a
list of witnesses?!
Gray looks at Garrison, stony-faced.
GRAY: Perhaps a brief recess is in
order!
OPPENHEIMER: If I may? You gentlemen have

OPPENHEIMER: Because I was an idiot. I found
myself trying to give a tip to the
intelligence people, without
realizing that when you give a tip
you have to offer the whole story.
Asked for details, I went off on a
false pattern. There was no
microfilm, no consular attaché.
There weren’t three or more people
involved on the project. There was
one person involved. That was me.
ROBB: Why lie?
OPPENHEIMER: Clearly with the intention of not

GARRISON: Dr Rabi, what governmental
positions do you currently hold?
RABI: I’m Chairman of the General
Advisory Committee to the AEC,
succeeding Dr Oppenheimer.
GARRISON: And how long have you known Dr
Oppenheimer?
RABI: Since 1928. I know him quite well.
GARRISON: Well enough to speak on the bearing
of his character, loyalty and
associations?
RABI: Dr Oppenheimer is a man of
upstanding character, loyal to the
United States, to his friends and
to the institutions of which he is
a part. I’ve examined his security
file, and in spite of the
associations in there, I do not
believe Dr Oppenheimer is a
security risk, and that these
associations from the past should
bar him from continuing as a
consultant to the AEC.

Robb cross-examines Rabi-
ROBB: Dr Rabi, after the Russian A-bomb
test did Dr Lawrence come to see
you prior to the GAC meeting?
RABI: You’d be better off asking him.
ROBB: I fully intend to. Did he come to
you about the Hydrogen bomb?
RABI: Yes. We all felt that after the
Russian explosion we had to do
something to regain our position.
ROBB: So you agreed with those who felt
we should launch a programme for
the Super at that time?
RABI: No. There were all kinds of
legitimate concerns about the
allocation of our resources.
GRAY: Would you say Dr Oppenheimer was
unalterably opposed to the H-bomb?
RABI: No. He thought a fusion programme
would come at the expense of our
awfully good fission programme.
ROBB: But that proved not to be the case?
RABI: In the event, both could be done.
Los Alamos, which Dr Oppenheimer
founded, rose to the occasion and
worked miracles, absolute miracles.
ROBB: May I ask one more question? A
purely hypothetical question.

Suppose this board should not be

RABI: If you want to set me up on the
board then I’ll give you an answer.
But I’ve never hidden my opinion
that I think this whole proceeding
is a most unfortunate one.
ROBB: Why?
RABI: He’s a consultant- you don’t want
to consult the guy? Don’t. Why go
through all this against a man
who’s accomplished what Dr
Oppenheimer has? Look at his record-
we have an A-bomb and a whole
series of it, and we have a whole

BORDEN: I did.
ROBB: Did there co me a time when you

GARRISON: A moment, please!
Garrison holds up a finger, FRANTICALLY reading ahead-
GRAY: What’s the purpose of the delay?
He’s simply going to read this.
GARRISON: Mr Chairman, this is the first

see statements, at least one, which
I don’t think anybody would be
happy to have go into the record-
accusations that have not before
been made and are not part of the
indictment from Nichols.
Garrison holds up the letter -
GARRISON (CONT’D): Is it the opinion of the board that
these are matters into which
inquiry should now be directed?
I scan down the letter for what he’s seen. My face falls...
GRAY: Testimony of this witness is not in
any way going to broaden the
inquiry.
GARRISON: How can it avoid it, sir? Supposing
you should believe the witness? Mr
Robb is tasked by this board with
calling in witnesses, and he brings
in one to make accusations of a
kind that I don’t think belong
here.

ROBB: Mr Chairman, the witness wrote this
letter on his own initiative laying
out evidence which has already been
before the board. His conclusions
are valid testimony just like the
positive conclusions of friends of
Dr Oppenheimer. It cuts both ways.
GARRISON: How long has counsel been in
possession of the letter?
ROBB: Mr Garrison, I don’t think I should
be subject to cross-examination by
you.
GRAY: Mr Garrison, given that we on the
board have all read the letter,
isn’t it better to have it in the

Garrison says nothing. He looks at me, frustrated.
GRAY (CONT’D): Let’s proceed.
BORDEN: 'Dear Mr Hoover, the purpose of
this letter is to state my opinion,
based upon years of study of the
available classified evidence, that
more probably than not J. Robert
Oppenheimer is an agent of the
Soviet Union.'
I turn the letter face down, staring at its blank
whiteness...
BORDEN (CONT’D): 'The following conclusions are
justified. One: Between 1929 and
1942, more probably than not, J.
Robert Oppenheimer was a
sufficiently hardened Communist
that he volunteered information to
the Soviets. Two: More probably

Strauss glances at Counsel, satisfied.

HILL (CONT’D): The views I have to express are my

completely out of the government.
Strauss narrows his eyes...
SENATOR PASTORE: (friendly lob)
You’re referring to the hostility
of certain scientists directed at
Mr Strauss because of his
commitment to security, as
demonstrated in the Oppenheimer
affair?
HILL: No.

vindictiveness he demonstrated
against Dr Oppenheimer, and against

his official positions.
Counsel turns to Strauss, who is FIXATED on Hill. The Senate

BUSH: It appears to most scientists
around the country that Oppenheimer
is now being pilloried and put

expressed his honest opinions. The
written charges against him are in
a poorly written indictment which
the board should have rejected from
the outset.
EVANS: Dr Bush, I thought I was performing
a service to my country in hearing
this case.
BUSH: No board in this country should sit
in judgement of a man because he
expressed strong opinions. If you
want to try that case, you can try
me- I have expressed strong
opinions, often unpopular, many

Strauss fumes as Hill reads his statement.
HILL: From the standpoint of public
welfare, the most injurious
exercise of personal vindictiveness
in which Lewis Straus has engaged

prosecution of J. Robert
Oppenheimer, who had not hesitated
to disagree with Mr Strauss on
certain questions of fundamental
policy.

HILL (CONT’D):

Oppenheimer made mincemeat out of
Strauss’ position on the shipments
of isotopes to Norway, and Strauss
never forgave him this public
humiliation. Another controversy
between them centreed around their
differences in judgement on how the
H-bomb would contribute to national
security. Oppenheimer had
considerable influence and
prestige, and Strauss was able to
find a few ambitious men who also
disagreed with Oppenheimer’s
position, and envied him his
prestige in government circles.
Teller, in the audience, stares at Hill...
HILL (CONT’D): Strauss turned to the personnel
security system in order to destroy
Oppenheimer’s effectiveness-
SENATOR PASTORE: But, Dr Hill, we’ve already heard
that Mr Strauss did not bring the
charges, or participate in the
hearings against Dr Oppenheimer.
HILL: I realize that Mr Strauss didn’t
sign the letter of charges, but I
think when all of the evidence is
viewed, it becomes highly plausible
that the Oppenheimer matter was
initiated and carried through
largely through the animus of Lewis
Strauss.

questioning Dr Oppenheimer’s basic
loyalty to the United States in the

GROVES: By no means. I hope I didn’t lead
anybody to think otherwise for an
instant.
GARRISON: Would you say that the revocation
of Dr Oppenheimer’s position would
be in the public interest?
GROVES: The revocation under such extreme
publicity I think would be most
unfortunate, not because of the

leave to one side- but because of
the disastrous effect upon the

seen Dr Oppenheimer act in a way
which for me was exceedingly hard
to understand. I thoroughly
disagreed with him in numerous
issues, and his actions, frankly,

ROBB: Would you have supported the
dropping of a Hydrogen bomb on
Hiroshima?

INT. SENATE OFFICE -- DAY (B&W)

Strauss TURNS on the Senate Aide-
STRAUSS: But he wanted all the glory and
none of the responsibility. So he
needed absolution. He needed to be
a martyr. To suffer, and take the
sins of the world on his shoulders.
To say 'no, we cannot continue on
this road' even as he knew we’d
have to...

INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY (COLOUR)

I search for an answer- the FEET STAMPING ever LOUDER-
OPPENHEIMER: It would make no sense at all.
ROBB: Why?
OPPENHEIMER: The target is too small.
ROBB: Supposing there had been a target
in Japan big enough for a
thermonuclear weapon, would you
have opposed dropping it?
OPPENHEIMER: This was not a problem with
which I was confronted.
ROBB (CONT’D): I’m confronting you with it
now, sir. Would you have
opposed the dropping of a
thermonuclear weapon on Japan
because of moral scruples?
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): I believe I would, sir.
ROBB: Did you oppose the dropping of the
atom bomb on Hiroshima because of
moral scruples?
OPPENHEIMER: We set forth our-
ROBB (CONT’D): I’m asking you about it, not
'we'.
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): I set forth arguments against
dropping it. But I did not endorse
them.

INT. ROOM 2022, ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION -- DAY (COLOUR)

Robb gets right in my face, incredulous-
ROBB: You mean having worked night and
day for three years to build the
bomb, you then argued it shouldn’t
be used?
OPPENHEIMER: No. I was asked by the Secretary of
War what the views of scientists
were- I gave the views against and
the views for.
ROBB: You supported the dropping of
the atom bomb on Japan,
didn’t you?
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): What do you mean 'support'?
ROBB (CONT’D): You helped pick the target, didn’t
you?
OPPENHEIMER: I did my job- I was not in a policy-
making position at Los Alamos- I
would have done anything that I was
asked to do-
ROBB: You would have made the H-bomb too
wouldn’t you?
OPPENHEIMER: I couldn’t.
The STAMPING breaks rhythm to become CACOPHONOUS...
ROBB: I didn’t ask you that,
doctor!
OPPENHEIMER (CONT’D): I would have worked on it,
yes. But to run a labouratory
is one thing, to advise a
government is another.

ROBB (CONT’D): And the GAC report, which you co-
authored, following the Russian
atomic test said that a Super bomb
should never be produced, did it
not!
OPPENHEIMER: What we meant- what I meant- was
that it would be a better world if
there were no Hydrogen bombs in it.
LIGHT STABS THROUGH CRACKS IN THE WALL...
ROBB: Wouldn’t the Soviets do anything to
increase their military strength?
OPPENHEIMER: If we did it, they’d have to do it.
Our efforts would fuel their
efforts- just as it had with the
atomic bomb!
PLASTER BREAKS AWAY AS LIGHT POURS INTO THE ROOM... I JAM my
eyes closed, MORE AND MORE EXPOSED...
ROBB: 'Just as with the atomic bomb.'
Exactly. No moral scruples in 1945,
plenty in 1949...
The sound STOPS. The light is gone.
GRAY: (gentle)
Dr Oppenheimer, when did your
strong moral convictions develop
with respect to the Hydrogen bomb?
I open my eyes, exhausted...
OPPENHEIMER: When it became clear to me that we
would tend to use any weapon we
had.
Silence.

SENATE AIDE: Well, he’s not.
Strauss looks at the Senate Aide’s neck, wondering if he
could get one hand all the way around it.
STRAUSS: (speaking softly)
Do you still have enough votes, or
is the crowning moment of my career
about to become the most public
humiliation of my life?
The Senate Aide looks down at his buck slip, counts his

However, in the light of your

with your somewhat disturbing
conduct in relation to the Hydrogen

I barely hear the rest...
GRAY (CONT’D): A full written opinion, with a

The Senate Aide leaves him hanging for a beat.
SENATE AIDE: I’m afraid so, sir.
Strauss doesn’t know what to do or where to look.
STRAUSS: Who were the holdouts?
SENATE AIDE: There were three, led by the junior
senator from Massachusetts. Young

SENATE AIDE: Perhaps they will.
STRAUSS: He turned the scientists against

About Einstein, by the pond?

An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery
fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men,
stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the
Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the
vehicle.
The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA
Man.

CIA MAN: Dr. Pavel, I’m CIA.
Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a
briefcase.
DRIVER: He wasn’t alone.
CIA Man, confused, spots the Hooded Men. He turns to Dr.
Pavel.
CIA MAN: You don’t get to bring friends.
DR. PAVEL: (shaken)
They are not my friends.
DRIVER: Don’t worry, no charge for them.
CIA MAN: Why would I want them?

CIA Man grabs Hooded Man 1.
CIA MAN: What are you doing in the middle of

Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun.
The flight plan I just filed with
the Agency lists me, my men, and
Dr. Pavel here. But only one of
you.
CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man
1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind.
CIA MAN: FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON
MY AIRCRAFT! (Cocks weapon.)
SO...WHO PAID YOU TO GRAB DR.
PAVEL?!: Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special
Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet.
CIA MAN: HE DIDN’T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO
TRY NEXT?!: The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door.
CIA MAN: TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE
WEAR THE MASK?!: The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the
man’s hood - he cocks the gun...nothing.
CIA MAN: LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN!
THIRD PRISONER (O.S.): Or he’s wondering why someone would
shoot a man before throwing him out
of an aeroplane.
CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.
CIA MAN: Wiseguy, huh? At least you can
talk. Who are you?
THIRD PRISONER: We are nothing. We are the dirt
beneath your feet. And no one cared
who I was until I put on the
mask...
CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his
hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The
eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.

BANE: Who we are does not matter. What
matters is our plan.
CIA MAN: (fascinated)
If I pull this off, will you die?
BANE: It would be extremely painful.
CIA MAN: You’re a big guy -
BANE: For you.
CIA MAN: (unnerved)
Was being caught part of your plan?
BANE: Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours. We had to
know what he told you about us.
DR. PAVEL: Nothing! I said nothing!
CIA MAN: Why not just ask him?
BANE: He would not have told us.
CIA MAN: You have methods.

legs wrapped around a seat back, The entire cabin upends.
Tumbling chaos - Soldiers falling - Bane cracks CIA Man’s

plane, smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud.
Dr. Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of
him - the plane vibrates, trying to tear itself apart.

The men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles
helplessly above the mountains. Its wings shear off.

The men attach explosives to the tail, then jump away,
swinging out as the tail explodes.

An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the
Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables.
A body bag is lowered into the cabin. Bane lies it on the
seat backs next to Dr. Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body
the same age and build as Dr. Pavel.
Bane rips Dr. Pavel’s sleeve - pulls out a length of
surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr. Pavel’s arm -
runs the tube to the body’s arm... Dr. Pavel watches,
horrified, as Bane starts compressions on the body’s chest,
drawing Dr. Pavel’s blood across the tube and into the
body...
An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man 1 up through the cabin and

HOODED MAN 2: Have we started the fire?

Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr.
Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr. Pavel’s seat belt. Dr.
Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle.
BANE: Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for
fear...
Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the
vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.

Drifting over the vast city...
MAYOR (V.O.): Harvey Dent Day may not be our

MAYOR (V.O.): But we’re here tonight because it’s
one of the most important...
...over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side...
8.
MAYOR (V.O.): Harvey Dent’s uncompromising stand
against organized crime and, yes,
ultimately, his sacrifice, have
made Gotham a safer place than it
was at the time of his death, eight
years ago...
...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor
addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham.
MAYOR: This city has seen a historic
turnaround. No city is without
crime. But this city is without
organized crime because the Dent
Act gave law enforcement teeth in
its fight against the mob. Now
people are talking about repealing
the Dent Act. And to them I
say...not on my watch.
Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up.
I want to thank the Wayne
Foundation for hosting this event.
I’m told Mr. Wayne couldn’t be here
tonight, but I’m sure he’s with us
in spirit...
High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching.
MAYOR (O.S): Now I’m going to give way to an
important voice...
Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some
sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in.
CONGRESSMAN: Commissioner.
GORDON: Congressman.
CONGRESSMAN: Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of
these things?
Gordon shakes his head. Gordon’s Deputy Commissioner, Foley,
cuts in.
9.
FOLEY: No one has. Not in years.
MAYOR (O.S): He can tell you about the bad old
days, when the criminals and
corrupt ran this town with such a
tight grasp that people put their
faith in a murderous thug in a mask
and a cape. A thug who showed his
true nature when he betrayed the
trust of this great man - (Turns to
picture of Dent.) And murdered him
in cold blood.
The Congressman watches a tray of canapés breeze past, then
grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes.
CONGRESSMAN: Sweetheart, not so fast with the
chow.
MAID: (turns, tight smile)
Shrimp balls?
The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The
Congressman glances down at Gordon’s papers.
MAYOR (O.S): Jim Gordon can tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent...
CONGRESSMAN: Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech?
We’re gonna be here all night.
GORDON: Maybe the truth about Harvey isn’t
so simple, Congressman.
MAYOR (O.S): But I’ll let him tell you himself -
Commissioner Gordon?
Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long
speech. Thinks.
GORDON: The truth...?
INSERT CUT: Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens
Gordon’s son with a handgun.
10.
Gordon surveys the audience. Deciding.
I have written a speech telling the
truth about Harvey Dent...
Gordon folds up his speech.
Maybe the time isn’t right...
Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman
mutters under his breath.
CONGRESSMAN: Thank Christ for that...
GORDON: Maybe right now all you need to
know is that there are a thousand
inmates in Blackgate Prison as a
direct result of the Dent Act.
These are violent criminals,
essential cogs in the organized
crime machine that terrorized
Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now,
all I should say about Harvey
Dent’s death is this...it has not
been for nothing.
The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion.
People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches
Foley.
GORDON: The second shift reports in?
FOLEY: On your desk. But you should put in
some more time with the Mayor -
GORDON: That’s your department.
Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.
CONGRESSMAN: Anyone shown him the crime stats?
FOLEY: He goes by his gut, and it
continues to bother him, whatever
the numbers.
CONGRESSMAN: Must be popular with the wife.
11.
FOLEY: Not really. She took the kids and
moved to Cleveland.
CONGRESSMAN: He’ll have plenty of time for
visits. Mayor’s dumping him in the
spring.
FOLEY: Really? He’s a hero.
CONGRESSMAN: War hero. This is peacetime. Stay
smart, the job’s yours.

INT. KITCHENS, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

Our Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs -
Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff. She overhears another Maid.
MAID 2: They say he never leaves the East
Wing.
MAID 3: I heard he had an accident - that
he’s disfigured.
The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has
died. Alfred has entered the kitchen.
ALFRED: Mr. Till, why are your people using
the main stairs?
Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered
plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen.
ALFRED: Where’s Mrs. Bolton?
MAID: She’s up at the bar, sir. Can I
help?
Alfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray.
ALFRED: The East drawing room. Unlock the
door, place the tray on the table,
lock the door again. Nothing more.

The Maid nods. Takes the tray.

The room is dark, quiet. The Maid places the tray on the

INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

Alfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate.
ALFRED: I’m sorry, Miss Tate, but I’ve
tried. He won’t see you.
MIRANDA: It’s important, Mr. Pennyworth.
Her accent is European. Hard to place.
ALFRED: Mr. Wayne is as determined to
ignore important things as trivial
ones.
MALE VOICE (O.S.): Don’t take it personally, Miranda.
They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett.
DAGGETT: Everyone knows Wayne’s holed up in
there with eight-inch nails, peeing
into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good
of you to let me on the grounds.
ALFRED: The Dent Act is about all Gotham.
Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate,
always a pleasure.
Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.
13.
DAGGETT: Why waste your time talking to the
man who threw away your investment
on some save-the-world vanity
project? He can’t help you get your
money back. But I can.
MIRANDA: I could try explaining that a
save-the-world project, vain or
not, is worth investing in,
whatever the return. I could try,
Mr. Daggett, but you understand
only money and the power you think
it buys, so why waste my time,
indeed?
She walks away. Daggett watches her go.

INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach.
Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples.
He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing
something. He slowly limps into the next room...

INT. SITTING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR, CONTINUOUS

The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and
Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery
target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow
sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.
Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite
bow. Picks up his cane.
MAID: I’m, I’m terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.
It is Mr. Wayne, isn’t it?
Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.
MAID: Although you don’t have the long
nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial
scars...
She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.
WAYNE: Is that what they say about me?
14.
MAID: It’s just that...nobody sees you...
Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.
WAYNE: That’s a beautiful necklace.
Reminds me of the one that belonged
to my mother. It can’t be the same
one - her pearls are in this safe -
He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
bureau, revealing a safe door...
- which the manufacturer clearly
explained is uncrackable.
...which swings open with an awkward creak.
MAID: Oops. No one told me it was
uncrackable.
The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.
WAYNE: I’m afraid I can’t let you take
those.
She smiles at him. Moves towards him.
MAID: Look, you wouldn’t hit a woman any
more than I would beat up a
cripple.
She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.
Of course, sometimes exceptions
have to be made.
The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.
Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.
She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then
rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace.
He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...

EXT. DRIVE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her
white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and
pearls. A Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she
slips into a town car...beside the Congressman.
15.
MAID: Can I have a ride?
The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily.
CONGRESSMAN: You read my mind.

INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - LATER

Alfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe.
ALFRED: Miss Tate was asking to see you
again.
WAYNE: She’s very persistent.
ALFRED: And quite lovely, in case you were
wondering.
WAYNE: I wasn’t.
ALFRED: What are you doing?
WAYNE: Examining print dust. We’ve been
robbed.
ALFRED: And this is your idea of raising
the alarm?
WAYNE: (shrugs)
She took the pearls. Tracking
device and all.
ALFRED: She?
WAYNE: One of the maids, perhaps you
should stop letting them in this
side of the house.
16.
ALFRED: Perhaps you should learn to make
your own bed, then. Why are you
dusting for prints?
WAYNE: I’m not. She was.

EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT - CONTINUOUS

Gordon brings a stack of files against the air duct, settles
to read. Next to him is a rusty, broken searchlight.
YOUNG VOICE (O.S.): Sir?
A young Cop is standing there. This is Blake.
BLAKE: I didn’t want to bother you up
here, but they’re looking for you.
GORDON: What’s the problem, son?
BLAKE: Congressman Gilly’s wife’s been
calling. He hasn’t made it home
from the Wayne Foundation event.
GORDON: That’s a job for the police?
BLAKE: Sir, I’ve been a cop for a year and
I’ve only logged half a dozen
arrests. When you and Dent cleaned
the streets you cleaned ’em good.
Pretty soon we’ll be chasing
overdue library books.
Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.
BLAKE: But here you are. Like we’re still
at war...
GORDON: Old habits.
17.
BLAKE: Or instinct.
GORDON: What’s your name, son?
BLAKE: Blake, sir.
GORDON: You have something you want to ask
me, Officer Blake?
BLAKE: It’s that night. This night, eight
years ago. The night Dent died.
GORDON: What about it?
BLAKE: The last confirmed sighting of the
Batman. He murders those people,
takes out two SWAT teams, breaks
Dent’s neck...then just vanishes?
GORDON: I’m not hearing a question, son.
Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon.
BLAKE: Don’t you want to know who we was?
Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes
his fingers across its rusted shell.
GORDON: I know exactly who he was. (Turns
to Blake.) He was Batman.
Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs.
GORDON (O.S.): Let’s go see about the
Congressman’s wife...
18.

INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING

Alfred takes his tray into the bedroom. The bed is empty.
ALFRED: Master Wayne?
Alfred’s voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply.

INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

Alfred hits three notes on the piano. The bookcase opens.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

Alfred descends into the caverns beneath Wayne Manor.

INT. BATCAVE - CONTINUOUS

Alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to
lower, becoming a ramp. At the bottom, Alfred is level with
a series of dark slate obelisks - a bridge over the water to
where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube.
ALFRED: You haven’t been down here in a
long time...
WAYNE: Just trying to find out more about
our jewel thief. I ran her prints
from the photos she handled -
Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery
suspect.
- but she was wearing someone
else’s fingerprints. She’s good.
ALFRED: She may be. But we have the trace
on the necklace.
WAYNE: We do, so I cross-referenced the
address she went back to with
police data on high-end
B-and-E’s...
Wayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears.
Selina Kyle. The databases are full
of close calls, tips from fences...
19.
Newspaper headlines appear -
THE CAT STRIKES AGAIN, POLICE SUSPECT ’CAT’ BURGLAR IN JEWEL
HEIST.:
WAYNE: She’s good, but the ground is
shrinking beneath her feet.
ALFRED: We should send the police before
she fences the pearls.
WAYNE: She won’t. She likes them too much.
And they weren’t what she was
after.
ALFRED: What was she after?
WAYNE: My fingerprints. There was printer
toner mixed with graphite on the
safe. Gives you a good pull, and
it’s untraceable.
ALFRED: Fascinating. Maybe you should
exchange notes over coffee.
WAYNE: Now you’re trying to set me up with
a jewel thief?
ALFRED: At this point, sir, I would set you
up with a chimpanzee if I thought
it would bring you back into the
world.
WAYNE: There’s nothing out there for me.
ALFRED: And that’s the problem. You hung up
the cape and cowl, but never moved
on. You won’t get out there and
find a life. Find someone -
WAYNE: (bitter)
I did find someone, Alfred.
20.
ALFRED: I know. And then you lost them.
That’s part of living, sir. But
you’re not living - you’re waiting.
Hoping for things to go bad again.
Wayne says nothing.
Remember when you left Gotham?
Before all this. Before Batman.
Seven years you were gone. Seven
years I waited. Hoping that you
wouldn’t come back.
Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding.
Every year I took my holiday. I’d
go to Florence. There’s a café by
the Arno... Any fine evening I
would sit there and order a Fernet
Branca...
INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a café sipping his drink...
I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine
that one day I’d look across the
tables, and see you. Sitting there
with your wife. Perhaps some kids.
You wouldn’t say anything to me, or
me to you, but we’d both
know...that you’d made it. That you
were happy.
INSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks
closer, hopeful. But they are strangers.
I never wanted you to come back to
Gotham. I knew there was nothing
there for you but pain and tragedy,
and I wanted more for you than
that. I still do.
Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats.

EXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - DAY

Blake and his partner, Ross, get out of their patrol car. A
DWP Man leads them down a long concrete trough.
DWP MAN: They wash up a couple times a
month. More when in gets colder -
homeless sheltering in the tunnels.
We had to pull him to clear the
basin, but other than that we
didn’t touch him...
21.
They come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies
a body - a teenage boy. Blake looks down at him. Freezes.
ROSS: What?
BLAKE: Name’s Jimmy. He’s at St.
Swithin’s. (Off look.) The boys
home where I...I coach some ball.

EXT. ST. SWITHIN’S HOME FOR BOYS - DAY

Blake looks up at the shabby building.

INT. ST. SWITHIN’S HOME FOR BOYS - MOMENTS LATER

Blake is talking to Father Reilly.
FATHER REILLY: Jimmy hadn’t been here for months.
BLAKE: Why?
FATHER REILLY: You know why, Blake - he aged out.
We don’t have the resources to keep
boys on after sixteen -
BLAKE: The Wayne Foundation gives money
for that -
FATHER REILLY: Not for two years now.
BLAKE: He has a brother here, right?
FATHER REILLY: Mark. I’ll tell him.
BLAKE: I’d like to, if that’s okay.
22.

EXT. PLAYGROUND, ST. SWITHIN’S - MOMENTS LATER

Father Reilly watches as Blake sits with Mark - ten.
BLAKE: I’m sorry.
Mark nods slowly. Staring straight ahead.
BLAKE: What was he doing in the tunnels?
MARK: Lot of guys been going down the
tunnels when they age out. Say you
can live down there. Say there’s
work down there.
BLAKE: What kind of work are you gonna
find in the sewers?
MARK: More than you can find up here, I
guess.
Blake considers this. Troubled.

INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

Selina Kyle, in a little black dress, walks in with a drunk
in a Hawaiian shirt. She sits him on a bar stool - walks
over to a table where a neatly dressed man, Stryver, sits.
STRYVER: You brought a date?
SELINA: I like having someone around to
open doors for me.
Selina glances around. Things scattered throughout the bar.
Jumpy. Selina hands an envelope to Stryver.
SELINA: Right hand. No partials.
Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it
up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers.
23.
STRYVER: Very nice.
He pockets the envelope.
SELINA: Not so fast, handsome. You got
something for me?
STRYVER: Oh, yes.
Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door. Another Thug
joins them at the table. Selina smiles.
SELINA: I don’t know what you’re going to
do with Mr. Wayne’s prints...but
I’m guessing you’ll need his thumb.
As Stryver checks the envelope again -
SELINA: You don’t count so good, huh?
STRYVER: I count fine.
The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina’s head.
STRYVER: In fact, I’m counting to ten right
now...
Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She
blinks.
SELINA: Okay, okay -
She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in
himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.
SELINA: My friend is waiting outside. Just
hit ’send’...
Stryver looks at the phone. Hits ’send’. Selina sizes up her
options. A knock on the door. Second Thug hides his gun. The
door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots
Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.
24.
JEN: Place is a little dead.
SELINA: (takes envelope, tense)
It’ll liven up in a minute, trust
me.
JEN: Everything okay?
SELINA: Great. Catch you later.
Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.
SELINA: It would’ve been a lot easier to
just give me what we agreed.
STRYVER: We can’t have loose ends. And even
in that dress, no one’s going to
miss you.
SELINA: No. But my friend over there...?
Stryver looks at Selina’s ’date’ drooling into a bowl of
nuts at the bar - he looks familiar...
SELINA: Every cop in the city’s missing
him.
Across the bar, the TV on mute -
MANHUNT FOR MISSING CONGRESSMAN.
Stryver looks at Selina.
STRYVER: Cute. But they’re not gonna be
looking in a place like this.
SELINA: I don’t know... You did just use
his cell phone.
Stryver glances down at the cell phone as - SCREECH - the
Thugs look out the window at cop cars and SWAT units
descending on the bar. Stryver glances at the window and -
SMASH - Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs
25.
Second Thug’s gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the
other Thugs, who drop. The SWATs batter down the door.
Selina crouches, cowering, screaming.
SWAT: It’s alright, Miss. Just stay down
-
The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back
through the bar and out into the back alley. Selina smiles.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

The Thugs turn and open up on the SWATs with automatic
weapons.

INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

Selina moves to the door. Spots the Congressman under the
bar, clutching his bleeding leg.
SELINA: Keep some pressure on that,
sweetheart.
She adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar.
Moves for the door.
CONGRESSMAN: (weak)
Call me?

EXT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

Selina waltzes out - right into Blake. She feigns panic.
SELINA: There’s a man in there - he’s
bleeding!
BLAKE: It’s okay, Miss. It’s okay.
Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a SWAT truck.
He heads into the bar, weapon drawn. Selina slips behind the
truck and into the night.
26.

INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

Blake enters, gun drawn. Spots the Congressman.
BLAKE: (into radio)
I’ve got the Congressman - bullet
to the leg, but he’s okay.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

The SWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then
race around a corner into a smaller passage.
A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon
jumps out, gun drawn.
The SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners
tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals,
counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high.
The passage is empty.
The SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once -
GORDON: Manhole!
He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover,
Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT.
GORDON: You three, down with me. You two,
head down to cover the next exit -
SWAT: Where -?
GORDON: Get the DWP down here, now!
Gordon starts climbing down the ladder...

INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

Gordon moves down the tunnel, flashlight low. Three SWATs
fall in behind...
27.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

Blake comes into the alley. Cops surround the manhole.
COP: Where’s the DWP guy?
BLAKE: They went down there?
FOLEY: (shaking his head)
And Gordon took SWAT in after them.

INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

Gordon hears a noise up ahead - pushes forward, rounds the
corner. BANG! GUNFIRE. SWATs return fire, shots sparking off
the concrete walls, then - BOOM - behind him the tunnel
ERUPTS IN FIRE, blasting the SWATs. Gordon races forward,
tearing through the tunnels.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

Blake jumps back as a fireball bursts out of the manhole.

INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

Gordon races around a corner, gun drawn. A noise makes him
turn - WHACK, he is clobbered from behind by a Thug.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

Blake pushes forward.
BLAKE: Come on, we gotta get down there -
COP: That was a gas explosion, kid -
BLAKE: Gas? This is a sewer!
FOLEY: No one goes in there till we know
what’s down there.
28.
BLAKE: We know what’s down there, sir. The
Police Commissioner!
FOLEY: Somebody get the hothead out of
here. And get me a DWP guy!
Blake backs off. Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car.

INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

Thug 1 flips Gordon onto his back.
THUG 1: This one’s alive. (Looks closer.)
Jesus. It’s the Police
Commissioner.
THUG 2: What do we do?
THUG 1: Take him to Bane.
The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels.
As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular
men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls
and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed
Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They
stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon
between two waterfalls, into -

INT. BANE’S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the
firelight. Bare-chested, muscular, masked. Bane. A crooked
line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine...
BANE: Why are you here?
The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane’s feet.
THUG 1: Answer him!
Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.
29.
BANE: I’m asking you.
THUG 1: It’s the Police Commissioner.
BANE: And you brought him down here?
THUG 2: We didn’t know what to do. We -
BANE: You panicked. And your weakness
costs three lives.
THUG 1: No, he’s alone -
Bane flips the Thug’s chin up and to the side with a crack.
Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2.
BANE: Search him. Then I will kill you.
The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon’s badge, wallet,
gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read.
Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at
the papers. Unfolds them...
As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the
rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out...
THUG 2: He’s dead.
Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers...
BANE: Then show me his body.
THUG 2: That water runs to any one of the
outflows - we’d never find him.
Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary.
BANE: Give me your GPS.
Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2’s
jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.
30.
BANE: Follow him.
THUG 2: Follow him?
Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead
Mercenary.
BANE: Track him. Make sure both bodies
will not be found. Then brick up
the south tunnel.

EXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - NIGHT

Blake comes out to the catchment basin. He spots something
stuck up against the grille, thrusts his hand into the
raging waters - Gordon is there, alive. Just. Blake pulls
him up onto the concrete, hoists him up, hurrying...

INT. FRONT HALL, WAYNE MANOR - DAY

Alfred opens the door to reveal Blake in his dirty uniform.
BLAKE: I need to see Brice Wayne.
ALFRED: I’m sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn’t take
unscheduled calls. Even from police
officers.
BLAKE: And if I go get a warrant, in the
investigation of Harvey Dent’s
murder? Would that still count as
unscheduled?

INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

Blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous. Wayne enters.
WAYNE: What can I do for you, officer?
BLAKE: Commissioner Gordon’s been shot.
31.
WAYNE: I’m sorry to hear that
-
BLAKE: He chased a gunman down into the
sewers. When I pulled him out he
was babbling about an underground
army. A masked man called ’Bane’.
WAYNE: Shouldn’t you be telling this to
your superior officers?
BLAKE: I did. One of them asked if he saw
any giant alligators down there. He
needs you. He needs the Batman.
WAYNE: If Commissioner Gordon thinks I’m
the Batman he must be in a bad way
-
BLAKE: He doesn’t know or care who you
are. (Off look.) But we’ve met
before. When I was a kid. At the
orphanage. See, my mom died when I
was small. Car accident, I don’t
really remember it. But a couple of
years later my dad was shot over a
gambling debt. I remember that just
fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot
of people who what it feels like,
do they? To be angry. In your
bones. People understand, foster
parents understand. For a while.
Then they expect the angry kid to
do what he knows he can never do.
To move on. To forget.
Wayne stares at Blake.
BLAKE: So they stopped understanding and
sent the angry kid to a boys’ home
- St. Swithin’s. Used to be funded
by the Wayne Foundation. See, I
figured it out too late. You have
to hide the anger. Practice smiling
in the mirror. Like putting on a
mask. You showed up one day in a
cool car, pretty girl on your arm.
(MORE): 32.
BLAKE (cont’d)
We were so excited - Bruce Wayne,
billionaire orphan. We made up
stories about you. Legends. The
other boys’ stories were just that.
But when I saw you I knew who you
really were... (Beat.) I’d seen
that look on your face. Same one I
taught myself.
Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought.
BLAKE: I don’t know why you took the fall
for Dent’s murder, but I’m still a
believer in the Batman. Even if
you’re not.
WAYNE: Why did you say your boys’ home
used to be funded by the Wayne
Foundation?
BLAKE: Because the money stopped. Might be
time to get some fresh air and
start paying attention to the
details. Some of those details
might need your help.

INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

Wayne and Alfred watch Blake drive away.
WAYNE: You checked that name? ’Bane’ -
ALFRED: Ran it through some databases. He’s
a mercenary. No other known name.
Never been seen or photographed
without a mask. He and his men were
behind a coup in West Africa that
secured mining operations for our
friend John Daggett.
WAYNE: Now Daggett’s brought them here?
ALFRED: It would seem so. I’ll keep
digging.
33.
Alfred turns to leave.
WAYNE: Why did the Wayne Foundation stop
funding boys’ homes in the city?
ALFRED: The Foundation is funded from the
profits of Wayne Enterprises...
(Off look.) There have to be some.
WAYNE: Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.
ALFRED: I’ll get him on the phone -
WAYNE: No. Do we still have any cars
around the place?
ALFRED: (lights up)
One or two.
WAYNE: And I need an appointment at the
hospital. About my leg.
ALFRED: Which hospital, sir?
WAYNE: Whichever one Jim Gordon’s in.
Alfred is less excited by this part of the request.

EXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - DAY

Moving towards the tall skyscraper downtown.
MIRANDA (V.O.): Mr. Fox, I believe in what Mr.
Wayne was trying to do...

INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS

Miranda is talking to Lucius Fox at the table.
34.
MIRANDA: I’m only asking for explanations
because I think I can help.
FOX: I’ll pass along your request. Next
time I see him.
Miranda catches something in this.
MIRANDA: He doesn’t talk to you either?
FOX: Let’s just say that Bruce Wayne has
his...eccentricities.
MIRANDA: (rising)
Mr. Fox, are you aware that John
Daggett is trying to acquire shares
in Wayne Enterprises?
FOX: I was not. But it wouldn’t do him
any good - Mr. Wayne still retains
a clear majority.
Miranda leaves. Fox moves into his office - stops.
FOX: Bruce Wayne. As I live and breathe.
Wayne rises, pushing hard on his cane.
FOX: What brings you out of cryo-sleep
Mr. Wayne?
WAYNE: I see you haven’t lost your sense
of humor...even if you have lost
most of my money.
FOX: Actually, you did that yourself.
See, if you funnel the entire R and
D budget for five years into a
fusion project that you then
mothball, your company is unlikely
to thrive.
35.
WAYNE: Even with -
FOX: A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes.
Wayne Enterprises is running out of
time. And Daggett is moving in.
WAYNE: What’re my options?
FOX: If you’re not willing to turn your
machine on -
WAYNE: I can’t, Lucius.
FOX: Then sit tight. Your majority keeps
Daggett at arm’s length while we
figure out a future for the energy
program with Miranda Tate - she’s
supported your project all the way.
She’s smart, and quite lovely.
WAYNE: You too, Lucius?
FOX: We all just want what’s best for
you, Bruce. Show her the machine.
WAYNE: I’ll think it over.
FOX: Anything else?
WAYNE: No, why?
FOX: These conversations always used to
end with some...unusual requests.
WAYNE: I retired.
FOX: Let me show you some stuff, anyway.
Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden
elevator.
36.

INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - MOMENTS LATER

Fox leads Wayne into the vast, gadget-filled space. They
pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations...
WAYNE: I figured you’d have shut this
place down.
FOX: It was always shut down,
officially.
WAYNE: But all this new stuff?
FOX: After your father died, Wayne
Enterprises set up fourteen
different defense subsidiaries.
I’ve spent years shuttering them
and consolidating all the
prototypes under one roof. My roof.
WAYNE: Why?
FOX: Stop them falling into the wrong
hands. Besides, I thought someone
might get some use out of them...
Wayne shakes his head.
FOX: Sure I can’t tempt you to
something? Pneumatic crampons?
Infrared lenses? Least let me get
you something for that leg.
WAYNE: It’s fine the use it gets these
days.
FOX: Well, then I have just the thing
for an eccentric billionaire who
doesn’t like to walk...
Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne’s eyes
light up.
37.
WAYNE: Now you’re just showing off.
FOX: Defense Department project for
tight-geometry urban pacification.
Rotors configured for maneuvering
between buildings without
recirculation.
WAYNE: What’s it called?
FOX: It has a long and uninteresting
Wayne Enterprises designation. So I
took to calling it the Bat. And
yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in
black.
Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.
FOX: Works great except for the
autopilot.
WAYNE: What’s wrong with that?
FOX: Software-based instability. Take a
better mind than mine to fix it.
WAYNE: Better mind?
FOX: I was trying to be modest. A less
busy mind. Yours, perhaps.
Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.
WAYNE: I told you. I retired, Lucius.

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an X-ray.
DOCTOR: I’ve seen worse cartilage in knees
-
38.
WAYNE: That’s good -
DOCTOR: No, that’s because there is no
cartilage in your knee. And not
much of any use in your elbows and
shoulders. Between that and the
scar tissue on your kidneys,
residual concussive damage to your
brain tissue and general
scarred-over quality of your
body... (Takes a deep breath.) I
cannot recommend that you go
heli-skiing. About the only part of
your body that looks healthy is
your liver, so if you’re bored I
recommend you take up drinking, Mr.
Wayne.
Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask,
steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane,
which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the
frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as -

EXT. TENTH FLOOR, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Wayne drops three floors...

INT. PRIVATE ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL - CONTINUOUS

Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in ski
mask, stands over him. Gordon’s eyes flutter open. He tries
to speak with a weak, hoarse voice...
GORDON: We were in this together. Then you
were gone...
WAYNE: The Batman wasn’t needed anymore.
We won.
GORDON: Built on a lie. Our lie. Now
there’s evil rising from where we
tried to bury it. Nobody will
listen... The Batman has to come
back.
39.
WAYNE: What if he doesn’t exist anymore?
GORDON: He must. He must.

INT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI ON GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT

Wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town
houses. Checks a tracking device. Jon, provocatively
dressed, leads a Yuppie Banker-type in through a front door.

INT. SELINA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out. She
picks up the pearls - hears a disturbance in the hall.
JEN (O.S.): I told you - money first -
YUPPIE (O.S.): Goddammit, you took my wallet!

INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The Yuppie has Jen against the wall - he reaches back to hit
her with an expensive wristwatch-clad arm. But Selina has
grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip.
SELINA: Get out.
YUPPIE: She took my wallet!
Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.
SELINA: Now.
She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs.
Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.
SELINA: I told you not to try it with the
assholes, Jen.
JEN: They’re all assholes.
40.
SELINA: Okay, the assholes who hit.
JEN: I don’t know what he’s so upset
about, he only had sixty bucks in
here.
SELINA: Probably the watch.
YOUNG WOMAN: Watch?
Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie’s Rolex.

EXT. SELINA’S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - LATER

Selina exits and hails a cab. Wayne watches her go. Then
pulls out. Checking his tracker.

EXT. MUSEUM, GOTHAM - LATER

Town cars dispense Gotham society in tasteful masquerade.
Wayne pulls up to the Valet. Paparazzi line the entrance.
Wayne uses his cane to get out of his Lamborghini...
PAPARAZZI: Another stiff too old to climb out
of his sports car.
PAPARAZZI 2: No, that’s Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne,
where you been hiding?
Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob
- a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door.
WAYNE: I’m not sure if my assistant put me
on the guest list -
GREETER: Right through here, Mr. Wayne...
41.

INT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

A lavish ball - the expressively attired dance under falling
confetti... Even Bruce Wayne is struck by the ostentation.
He spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit. She
wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. And the pearls.
MIRANDA (O.S): Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?
Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her
only concession to fancy dress.
WAYNE: Miss Tate, isn’t it?
MIRANDA: Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things...
WAYNE: True. Proceeds go to the big fat
spread, not the cause. It’s not
about charity, it’s about feeding
the ego of whichever society hag
laid it on.
MIRANDA: Actually, this is my party, Mr.
Wayne.
WAYNE: Oh.
MIRANDA: And the proceeds will go where they
should, because I paid for the big
fat spread myself.
WAYNE: That’s very generous of you.
MIRANDA: You have to invest to restore
balance to the world. Take our
clean-energy project...
WAYNE: Sometimes the investment doesn’t
pay off. Sorry.
42.
MIRANDA: You have a practiced apathy, Mr.
Wayne. But a man who doesn’t care
about the world doesn’t spend half
his fortune on a plan to save it...
(Gentle.) And isn’t so wounded when
it fails that he goes into
hiding...
Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued.
MIRANDA: Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.
Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.
WAYNE: Mind if I cut in?
Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes
Selina by the waist. She glares at him.
WAYNE: You don’t seem very happy to see
me.
SELINA: You were supposed to be a shut-in.
WAYNE: Felt like some fresh air.
SELINA: Why didn’t you call the police?
WAYNE: I have a powerful friend who deals
with this kind of thing. (Admires
her cat ears.) Brazen costume for a
cat burglar.
SELINA: Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
WAYNE: Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.
Who’s your date?
SELINA: His wife’s in Ibiza. She left her
diamonds behind, though. Worried
they’d get stolen.
43.
WAYNE: It’s pronounced ’Ibeetha’. You
wouldn’t want these folks realizing
you’re a crook not a social
climber.
SELINA: (flash of anger)
You think I care what anyone in
this room thinks about me?
WAYNE: I doubt you care what anyone in
this room thinks about you.
SELINA: Don’t condescend, Mr. Wayne. You
don’t know a thing about me.
WAYNE: Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came
here from your walk-up in Old Town
- modest place for a master jewel
thief. Which means either you’re
saving for your retirement - or
you’re in deep with the wrong
people.
SELINA: You don’t get to judge me because
you were born in the master bedroom
of Wayne Manor.
WAYNE: Actually, I was born in the Regency
Room.
SELINA: I started off doing what I had to.
Once you’ve done what you had to
they’ll never let you do what you
want to.
WAYNE: Start fresh.
SELINA: There’s no fresh start in today’s
world. Any twelve-year-old with a
cell phone could find out what you
did. Everything we do is collated
and quantified. Everything sticks.
We are the sum of our mistakes.
44.
WAYNE: Or our achievements.
SELINA: The mistakes stick better. Trust
me.
WAYNE: You think that justifies stealing?
SELINA: I take what I need to from those
who have more than enough. I don’t
stand on the shoulders of people
with less.
WAYNE: Robin Hood?
SELINA: I’d do more to help someone than
most of the people in this room.
Than you.
WAYNE: Maybe you’re assuming too much.
SELINA: Or maybe you’re being unrealistic
about what’s really in your pants
other than your wallet.
WAYNE: Ouch.
SELINA: You think all this can last?
Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.
SELINA: There’s a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.
You and your friends better batten
down the hatches, because when it
hits you’re all gonna wonder how
you ever thought you could live so
large and leave so little to the
rest of us.
WAYNE: Sounds like you’re looking forward
to it.
45.
SELINA: I’m adaptable.
WAYNE: These pearls do look better on you
then they did in my safe...
Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back
of her neck, unclasps the necklace.
But I still can’t let you keep
them.
The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina
looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears
into the crowd. Wayne’s cane reappears.
RICH TWIT: (annoyed)
You scared her off.
WAYNE: Not likely.

EXT. MUSEUM - MOMENTS LATER

Wayne approaches the Valet. Pats down his pockets.
WAYNE: I must have lost my ticket -
VALET: Your wife said you were taking a
cab home, sir.
WAYNE: My wife?

INT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI RACING DOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Selina permits herself a little smile as she guns the
engine.

INT. ROLLS ROYCE - LATER

Alfred watches in the mirror as Wayne climbs into the back.
ALFRED: Just you, sir?
Wayne gives him a withering glare.
(MORE): 46.
ALFRED (cont’d)
Don’t worry, Master Wayne. Takes a
little time to get back into the
swing of things.
Wayne dials his phone.
FOX (O.S.): This is Fox.
WAYNE: Remember those ’unusual requests’ I
used to make?
FOX (O.S.): I knew it!
Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned.

INT. BATCAVE - DAY

Wayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace
strapped to his good knee - the brace tones. As Wayne starts
moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a
Thermos.
ALFRED: You’ve got the wrong leg, sir.
WAYNE: You start with the good limb so it
learns your optimum muscle
patterns.
Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it
- the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious.
Now we tighten it up.
Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink
tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth.
ALFRED: It is terribly painful?
WAYNE: (gritted teeth)
You’re welcome to try it, Alfred.
ALFRED: Happy watching, thank you, sir.
Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.
47.
WAYNE: Not bad -
Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick.
Not bad at all.
Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows
Wayne across the bridge to the cube.
ALFRED: Master Wayne, if you’re considering
going back out there you need to
hear some rumors surrounding Bane.
WAYNE: I’m all ears.
ALFRED: There is a prison. In a more
ancient part of the world. A pit.
Where men are thrown to suffer and
die. But sometimes, a man rises
from the darkness. Sometimes...the
pit sends something back.
WAYNE: Bane.
ALFRED: Born and raised in a hell on earth.
WAYNE: Born in a prison?
ALFRED: No one knows why. Or how he
escaped. But they know who trained
him one he did...R¯a’s al Gh¯ul. Your
mentor.
Wayne takes this in. Shocked.
ALFRED: He plucked Bane from a dark corner
of the earth and trained him in the
blackest disciplines of combat,
deception and endurance. Just like
you.
WAYNE: Bane was a member of the League of
Shadows.
48.
ALFRED: Until he was excommunicated. And a
man considered too extreme for R¯a’s
al Gh¯ul is not to be trifled with.
WAYNE: I didn’t realize I was known for
trifling with criminals.
ALFRED: That was then. And you can strap up
your leg and put the mask back on.
But it won’t make you what you
were.
WAYNE: Which was?
ALFRED: Someone whose anger at death made
him value all life. Even his own.
WAYNE: If this man is all the things you
say he is, then this city needs me.
The Batsuit emerges from the cube.
ALFRED: Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne.
Your resources, your
knowledge...not your body. Not your
life. That time has passed.
WAYNE: I tried helping as Bruce Wayne,
Alfred. And I failed.
ALFRED: You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As
Batman, you can’t afford to.
WAYNE: That’s what you’re afraid of - that
if I go back out there I’ll fail.
ALFRED: No. I’m afraid that you want to.
Wayne looks at Alfred. Then turns to examine the Batsuit.
49.

INT. STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING

A frenzy of trading on the packed floor...
Two Traders sit on a shoeshine stand in the lobby.
TRADER 2: You can’t short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party -
TRADER 1: Wayne coming back is change. Change
is either good or bad.
TRADER 2: On what basis?
TRADER 1: I flipped a coin.
Near the front entrance: a Food Delivery Guy is standing
there negotiating with a Trader.
TRADER 3: No. Rye. I told ’em rye.
Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen.
Alright, I’ll take it.
He thrusts Food Guy a tip and grabs the bag, distracted...
At the rear secure entrance: a Motorcycle Courier enters,
wearing his helmet - a Female Security Guard gets in his
face.
FEMALE SECURITY GUARD: Rookie! Lose the helmet! (Points at
a camera.) We need faces for
cameras.
In the rest room: a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of
the way of two Traders who rush in to pee.
At the shoeshine stand, Trader 1 waves a bill down at the
man shining his shoes without a glance. Shoeshine Man takes
the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a
gym bag and checks an automatic weapon. He clicks the slide
home, then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading
floor.
At the secure entrance: the Courier pulls off his helmet.
The Female Security Guard’s eyes go wide.
50.
In the rest room: the Janitor reaches into his bucket and
pulls out a machine pistol in a Ziploc bag.
Near the front entrance: Food Guy pulls an automatic pistol
- clubs Trader 3 with it, pastrami flying. Shoeshine Man
moves onto the floor, pulls out his weapon.
Under the Courier’s helmet - a mask. Bane. He grabs the
Female Security Guard and throws her into her colleagues,
lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality.
Shoeshine Man fires into the large trading screens. The
floor erupts into a different frenzy - traders hit the deck,
screaming. Bane moves onto the floor...
TRADER 1: This is a stock exchange, there’s
no money you can steal -
He dries up as Bane stops. Turns to him...
BANE: Why else would you people be here?
Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the
floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the
man’s thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.
BANE: Enter your password. Or I send
these men to your home.
Trader 1, terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens.
Shoeshine man pulls out a USB drive with an antenna - plugs
it into the computer - figures race across the screen...

EXT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

Police vehicles screech into the narrow street -
construction vehicles are blocking. Blake argues with a
burly Construction Worker.
BLAKE: Move it, now! We’ve got a
situation.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER: Where can I move it?!
BLAKE: That way!
Blake points - but SWAT vehicles pile in, blocking.
51.
BLAKE: Get in your vehicle and stay there!
Foley and the SWAT Commander, Allen, approach the entrance.
The Market Security Chief walks up, frantic.
SECURITY CHIEF: You’ve gotta get in there!
FOLEY: This is a hostage situation -
SECURITY CHIEF: It’s a robbery! They’ve got direct
access to the online trading desk.
FOLEY: I’m not risking my men for your
money -
SECURITY CHIEF: It’s not our money, it’s
everyone’s!
ALLEN: Really? Mine’s in my mattress.
SECURITY CHIEF: If you don’t shut these guys down,
the stuffing in that mattress might
be worth a whole lot less, pal.
FOLEY: Cut the fiber line - shut down the
cell tower. That’ll slow them down.

INT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

Shoeshine Man looks up from the laptop.
SHOESHINE MAN: They cut the fiber. Cell’s working.
BANE: For now. How much longer does the
program need?
SHOESHINE MAN: Eight minutes.
52.
BANE: Time to go mobile.
Shoeshine Man picks up the laptop, slips it into his pack...

EXT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

Allen shouts at his men.
ALLEN: Get the barriers up - no more in
and out on this street!
Steel wedge-shaped barriers rise up at the mouth of the
street. A Sniper watches the doors through a thermal scope.
Six large heat signatures bloom, too big for people...
SNIPER: I’ve got something -
The door explodes. SWATs duck, six sportbikes race out and
leap the ramp-like barricades, sending SWATs scattering.
Cops scramble to pull their vehicles out to give chase.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

The bikes weave through traffic, Traders strapped to the
back, facing backwards - screaming, ties flying in the wind.
A cruiser falls in behind.
ROOKIE COP: Shoot the tires!
A Veteran Cop sights a shot, but the Traders are in the way.
VETERAN COP: No shot!

EXT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

Foley is barking into his radio.
FOLEY: Back off, back off! They’ve got
hostages!
53.

INT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The cruiser follows the bike into a large tunnel. A Rookie
Cop looks up into his rear-view.
ROOKIE COP: What’s going on with the lights?
The Veteran Cop looks back - streetlights and headlights are
dying one after another. The darkness is chasing them - the
darkness hits them. Their lights, sirens, and engine die...
And, out of the silence, a dark shape roars past -
VETERAN COP: It can’t be...
ROOKIE COP: The hell was that?!
VETERAN COP: Oh boy. You’re in for a show
tonight, son.

EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Food Guy drives the rear bike. He looks back - sees
streetlights explode behind him - darkness catching him up.
The engine chokes and dies. The Trader jumps off, shouting
for the cops. Food Guy turns, pulling his gun. SMASH! - Food
Guy is thrown backwards off his bike by a dark wing as
BATMAN races by on the Bat-Pod.

EXT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

Foley rushes to Blake’s cruiser.
FOLEY: Let’s roll, they’ve spotted the
Batman!

EXT. HIGHWAY INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

The remaining bikes split up as they reach a high overpass.
54.

EXT. HIGH OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS

Batman pulls up, overlooking the intersection - pulls a
rifle-shaped device. A tone builds - he aims it at the bike
and fires.

EXT. HIGHWAY OFF-RAMP - CONTINUOUS

Janitor’s bike sparks and dies. Sirens as Cops move in,
Another bike splutters and dies - the Hostage breaks for
cover.

EXT. HIGH OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS

Batman sees the last two bikes disappear beneath an
overpass. He holsters his EMP rifle and guns the Bat-Pod.

INT. BLAKE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

Foley, in the back, is using the cruiser as a mobile command
station.
FOLEY: (into radio)
Call everyone in - every car
patrol, beat cop, off-duty, too!
Pull ’em in, close every street!
Now!
Foley looks out at Gotham rushing by.
FOLEY: I’m gonna do what Gordon never
could.
BLAKE: What’s that?
FOLEY: I’m gonna take down the Batman.
BLAKE: Sir, what about the armed robbers?
Foley ignores him.
55.

EXT. GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS

All around the city, cops mobilize - cars, vans, choppers...

EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Bane pulls up at speed alongside Shoeshine Man. Shoeshine
Man glances inside his pack - signals ’2’. Bane turns, sees
darkness approaching, reaches back and grabs his Hostage,
lifting him onto the back of Shoeshine Man’s bike. Bane
peels off - Batman stays on Shoeshine Man.

INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

A Spotter watches Bane peel off, hits the radio.
SPOTTER: (into radio)
One bike’s pulled off, no hostage -

INT. BLAKE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

Foley listens to the radio, hungry -
SPOTTER: (over radio)
Should we pursue?
FOLEY: Negative! Stay on the Batman!
BLAKE: But he’s getting away!
FOLEY: (annoyed)
Who do you want to catch? Some
robber, or the son-of-a-bitch who
killed Harvey Dent?

INT. DAGGETT’S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Coverage of the pursuit blares from all the TVs, as Daggett
and Stryver watch. Tense.
TV ANNOUNCER: People aren’t saying much -
frankly, they’re too busy - but all
signs suggest that what we’re
(MORE): 56.
TV ANNOUNCER (cont’d)
seeing is, in fact, the return of
the Batman...

INT. INNER OFFICE, DAGGETT’S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Moving in on a shadow, crouched in front of Daggett’s safe,
working the dial... The shadow slides up a pair of goggles
onto the top of its head creating the silhouette of cat
ears. It is Catwoman. She turns to the TV, watching the
pursuit.
CATWOMAN: Well, what do you know?
Catwoman opens the safe. Nothing inside. She frowns.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Bane slips between two cruisers who tear after the Batman.
He jumps up onto a concrete barrier, then down to the mouth
of an outflow pipe. He glances at the entire Gotham Police
Department descending on one man. Disappears into the pipe.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Shoeshine Man glances into his pack - the program beeps,
finished. He looks back to see the Bat-Pod racing at him,
ducks as it comes alongside...riderless. Shoeshine Man looks
up, confused. WHUMP! His hostage is ripped off the bike by a
low-flying dark shape.
Shoeshine Man lays down the bike in a shower of sparks,
rolls off dazed. Batman grabs him.
BATMAN: WHAT WERE YOU STEALING?!
Shoeshine Man stares. Unafraid. Batman rips the computer
from his pack. The screen reads:
APPLICATION COMPLETE: Blinding light and noise as police choppers descend - sirens
everywhere. Batman grabs the USB drive from the laptop. He
jumps on the Bat-Pod - pauses, taking in the sight of
thousands of police, cars, choppers, dogs, closing in.
57.
POLICE VOICE: (over loudspeaker)
STEP AWAY FROM THE BIKE!
Batman looks at the line of stopped traffic. An empty car
transporter is below the on-ramp... Batman fires the cannons
at the transporter, the near ramp crashes down, and Batman
roars towards it - mounts it and jumps onto the on-ramp...

INT. DAGGETT’S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Daggett angrily grabs some ice cubes for his drink.
DAGGETT: After eight years he has to pick
tonight...
STRYVER: He’s drawing the cops off Bane...
Daggett watches, intrigued.

INT. BLAKE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

Foley shouts down the phone.
FOLEY: How did you let him go?!
COP: (over radio)
He’s got a lot of firepower -
FOLEY: And you don’t?! We’re not letting
one nut with a bad attitude and
some fancy gadgets run this town
down, you hear me?!
COP: (over radio)
He’s heading back downtown...
FOLEY: (excited)
Then he’s as dumb as he dresses -
close it down, gentlemen!
58.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Thousands of police jockey to pursue the Batman as he races
back into the downtown area.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - CONTINUOUS

The Bat-Pod tears along, pursued by a phalanx of cruisers,
choppers overhead. More cops appear at the far end of the
boulevard.
The Bat-Pod executes a ninety-degree turn, flipping over as
it goes, then guns into the darkness of a large blind alley.
Cruisers and choppers block the mouth of the alley. Blake
arrives last, his cruiser sealing the bottleneck. Foley
swaggers out.
FOLEY: Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen...
Foley reaches for a loudhailer. VARRROOOOM!! A noise from
the alley that none of the cops have heard before...
VETERAN COP: You might have the wrong animal
there, sir -
Spotlights smash on and a massive dark cyclone roars out of
the alley, spinning the choppers sideways, dual rotor
downdraft forcing all the cops to the ground.
The Bat, now black, thunders up and over the entire Gotham
PD. Blake slides up to Foley. Dry.
BLAKE: Are you sure that was him?
Foley looks at Blake. Thrusts the loudhailer at him.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Gordon, still hooked up to machines, watches TV. He smiles.
ANNOUNCER: (on TV)
Police are keeping quiet about the
prospect of a return by the Batman,
but eyewitness accounts seem the

59.

INT. DAGGETT’S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Daggett watches the TV coverage, concerned. Stryver enters.
STRYVER: Bane says the Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.
DAGGETT: What about the men they arrested?
STRYVER: He says, and I quote, they would
die before talking.
DAGGETT: (grins)
Where does he find these guys?
Daggett gets to his feet, relieved, moves to his inner
office.
Open the champagne...

INT. INNER OFFICE, DAGGETT’S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Daggett comes through the door, calling back.
DAGGETT: And can we get some girls in here?
CATWOMAN (O.S.): Careful what you wish for.
Catwoman grabs him, throws him across the room. His back
slams against the wall - he draws a gun, but - WHACK! -
Catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using
the high heel of her boot. He whimpers as she leans in.
CATWOMAN: Cat got your tongue?
She plucks the gun from his trembling hand.
DAGGETT: You dumb bitch.
CATWOMAN: Nobody ever accused me of being
dumb.
60.
DAGGETT: Dumb to show up here tonight.
CATWOMAN: I want what you owe me -
Click - Stryver has a gun to her head.
DAGGETT: ’I want’ never gets...
Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her
leg...
STRYVER: Nice outfit...those heels make it
tough to walk?
Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams.
CATWOMAN: I don’t know, do they?
Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett.
CATWOMAN: So where is it?
DAGGETT: Where’s what?
CATWOMAN: The program. The ’Clean Slate’.
DAGGETT: Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a
master thief with a record. I don’t
have it.
The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding
Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her
heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the
window. He screams - they drop...

EXT. WINDOW-CLEANING PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

...ten feet onto the window-cleaning platform. Catwoman uses
her bladed heel to cut a rope - the platform plunges down
the side of the building.
61.

EXT. FLAT ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

Catwoman dumps Daggett onto the roof, towering over him.
CATWOMAN: Where is it?
DAGGETT: The ’Clean Slate’? Type in a name
and date of birth and within a
couple hours that person ceases to
exist in any database? Little too
good to be true.
CATWOMAN: You’re lying. Rykin Data took it to
prototype stage -
DAGGETT: That’s why I bought them. But they
had nothing. It was a gangland
myth.
Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes
drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They’re not
Daggett’s bodyguards, these are Bane’s men... Catwoman holds
Daggett by the throat, threatening him.
CATWOMAN: Stay back!
They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer
onto his gun.
CATWOMAN: I’m not bluffing!
VOICE (O.S.): They know...
All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots
it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman.
BATMAN: They just don’t care.
As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps
forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the
fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman’s back - she
fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at
another’s head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to
miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.
62.
CATWOMAN: You’ve got to be kidding.
BATMAN: No guns. No killing.
CATWOMAN: Where’s the fun in that?
As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for
the far edge.
BATMAN: Come on!
Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof.
She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley -
sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open.
Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but
gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the
cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy
hisses shut, taking bullets from above.
CATWOMAN: My mother warned me about getting
into cars with strange men -
BATMAN: This isn’t a car.
Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky,
downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all
but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against
the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night.

EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER

The Bat lands - the canopy opens. Catwoman jumps out.
CATWOMAN: See you around -
Batman steps down after her.
BATMAN: You’re welcome.
CATWOMAN: I had it under control.
63.
BATMAN: Those weren’t street thugs - they
were trained killers. I saved your
life. In return I need to know what
you did with Bruce Wayne’s
fingerprints.
Catwoman looks at him. Considering.
CATWOMAN: Wayne wasn’t kidding about a
’powerful friend’. I sold his
prints to Daggett. For something
that doesn’t even exist.
BATMAN: I doubt many people get the better
of you.
CATWOMAN: Hey, when a girl’s desperate...
BATMAN: What were they going to do with
them?
CATWOMAN: I don’t know. But Daggett seemed
pretty interested in that mess at
the stock market.
Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past,
searching. Batman turns to it. Then turns back.
BATMAN: Miss Kyle -?
But she is gone.
So that’s what that feels like.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Alfred is studying security camera footage of Bane killing
at the stock exchange. A roar builds - the waterfall glows
brighter until...SMASH! The Bat breaches, downdraft spraying
water. Two cubes rise - the Bat lands, Batman jumps out.
Alfred brushes water off his suit.
ALFRED: Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell
the neighbors you got yourself a
new leaf-blower?
64.
WAYNE: We bought all the neighbors.
Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.
ALFRED: From the look of the television
coverage, you seem to have your
taste for wanton destruction back.
WAYNE: (pulls out USB drive)
I retrieved this.
ALFRED: Shouldn’t the police be gathering
the evidence?
WAYNE: They don’t have the tools to
analyze it.
ALFRED: They would if you gave them to them
-
WAYNE: One man’s tool is another man’s
weapon.
ALFRED: In your mind, perhaps. But there
aren’t many things you couldn’t
turn into a weapon.
WAYNE: Alfred. Enough. The police weren’t
getting it done -
ALFRED: Perhaps they would’ve if you
haven’t made a sideshow of
yourself.
WAYNE: Perhaps you’re upset you were
wrong.
ALFRED: Wrong?
65.
WAYNE: You thought I didn’t have it in me.
Alfred looks at him. Puts down the cape and cowl.
ALFRED: You don’t. You lead a bloated
police force on a merry chase with
some fancy new toys from Fox. What
about when you come up against him.
What then?
Alfred points to the monitor - Wayne sees Bane killing...
WAYNE: I’ll fight harder, I always have.
ALFRED: When you had something to fight
for. What are you fighting for now?
Not your life.
Wayne moves to switch off the monitor. Alfred grabs his
hand.
ALFRED: Take a good look. At his speed, his
ferocity, His training. I see the
power of belief. Of the fanatic. I
see the League of Shadows
resurgent.
WAYNE: You said he was excommunicated.
ALFRED: By R¯a’s al Gh¯ul. Who leads them
now?
WAYNE: R¯a’s al Gh¯ul was the League of
Shadows. And I beat him. Bane’s
just a mercenary, and we have to
find out what he’s up to.
Wayne plugs the USB in, hits keys. Text scrolls.
WAYNE: Trades of some kind. Coded...
The screen blanks, a thumb print appears.
66.
ALFRED: Is that -?
WAYNE: Mine. Courtesy of Selina Kyle.
Wayne pulls out the USB, rises.
Get this to Fox - he can crack the
code and tell us what trades they
were executing.
Alfred looks at Wayne. Takes the USB.

INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

As Wayne hits the bottom of the stairs, Alfred calls.
ALFRED: I’ll get this to Fox. But no more.
Waynne hears his tone of voice. Turns to him.
ALFRED: I’ve sewn you up and set your
bones...but I won’t bury you. I’ve
buried enough members of the Wayne
family.
WAYNE: You’d abandon me?
ALFRED: You see only one end to your story.
Leaving is all I have to make you
understand: you aren’t Batman
anymore - you have to find another
way. You used to talk about
finishing. About life beyond that
awful cave -
WAYNE: Rachel died knowing we’d decided to
be together. That was my life
beyond this cave and I can’t just
move on. She didn’t. She couldn’t.
Alfred considers this. Looks away.
ALFRED: What if he had? What if she wasn’t
intending to make a life with you?
67.
WAYNE: She was, I can’t change that -
ALFRED: What if, before she died, she’d
written a letter? Explaining that
she’d chosen Harvey Dent over you?
Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -
ALFRED: And what if, to spare you
pain...I’d burned that letter?
Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.
WAYNE: Why would you say such a thing?
ALFRED: Because I have to make you
understand.
WAYNE: You’re lying.
ALFRED: Because you are as precious to me
as you were to your own mother and
father and I swore to them that I
would protect you and I haven’t.
WAYNE: You’re lying!
ALFRED: I’ve never lied to you. Except when
I burned Rachel’s letter.
Wayne turns on the old man, furious.
WAYNE: How dare you use Rachel to stop me!
ALFRED: I’m using the truth, Master Wayne.
Maybe it’s time we all stopped
trying to outsmart the truth and
just let it have its day. I’m
sorry.
68.
WAYNE: Sorry?! You expect to destroy my
world, then shake hands?!
ALFRED: No. I know what this means -
WAYNE: What does it mean, Alfred?!
ALFRED: It means your hatred. It means
losing the person I’ve cared for
ever since I heard his first cries
echo through this house. But it
might also mean saving your life.
And that is more important.
Wayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to
say and says it quietly and calmly.
WAYNE: Goodbye, Alfred.
ALFRED: (quiet)
Goodbye, Bruce.
Wayne mounts the stairs...Alfred watches him go. Turns.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING

Wayne is woken by the doorbell.

INT. STAIRCASE, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

As Wayne moves through the empty house, tying his dressing
gown, he can’t resist one tentative.
WAYNE: Alfred?
But Alfred is gone.

INT. FRONT HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

Wayne opens the front door the find Fox. Fox is surprised.
69.
FOX: Answering your own door?
WAYNE: Yes. Could you decode the trades on
that drive?
Fox hands Wayne a newspaper - the main headline: BATMAN BACK TO FOIL OR MASTERMIND STOCK RAID...
FOX: I didn’t need to. Page three.
Wayne turns the page: WAYNE DOUBLES DOWN - AND LOSES...
FOX: It seems you made a series of large
put options on the futures
exchange. Verified by thumb print.
The options expired at midnight
last night.
Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling.
FOX: Long term we may be able to prove
fraud, but for now...you’re
completely broke. And Wayne
Enterprises is about to fall into
the hands of John Daggett.
WAYNE: The weapons - we can’t let Daggett
get his hands on Applied Sciences -
FOX: Applied Sciences is shut up tight,
and off the books. The energy
project is a different story.
WAYNE: Miranda Tate. We need to convince
the board to get behind her. Let’s
show her the reactor -
FOX: We’re meeting her there in
thirty-five minutes. You better get
dressed.
70.

EXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES RECYCLING PLANT - DAY

A scrapyard on the Gotham river. Across the water, the
towers of Gotham. Lucius leads Miranda from her car.
MIRANDA: You brought me out here to show me
a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox?
FOX: Bear with me, Miss Tate.
They arrive at a Portakabin and enter.

INT. PORTAKABIN - CONTINUOUS

Miranda looks around the derelict office. Fox smiles at her.
FOX: Keep your hands and feet inside the
car at all times.
He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked
as the office becomes an elevator into -

INT. ELEVATOR, FUSION REACTOR - CONTINUOUS

They descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel...
MIRANDA: This is it, isn’t it?
FOX: The reactor is beneath the river so
that it could be instantly flooded
in an event of a security breach.
MIRANDA: Is Bruce Wayne really that
paranoid?
FOX: I’m gonna plead the fifth on that
one.
Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a
figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.
WAYNE: I thought you might like to see
what your investment built.
71.
MIRANDA: No radiation, no fossil fuels.
Free, clean energy for an entire
city.
WAYNE: If it worked. It doesn’t.
Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of
electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal.
Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold.
WAYNE: Ignition, yes. But no chain
reaction.
MIRANDA: You’ve built a lot of security
around a damp squib.
Nothing.
About three years ago a Russian
scientist published a paper on
weaponized fusion reactions. One
week later your reactor started
developing problems... (Looks at
Wayne.) I think this machine works.
WAYNE: Miranda, if it were operational,
the danger to Gotham would be too
great.
MIRANDA: Would it make you feel better to
know that the Russian scientist
died in a plane crash six months
ago?
WAYNE: Someone else will work out what Dr.
Pavel did. Someone else will figure
out how to turn this power source
into a nuclear weapon. I need you
to take control of Wayne
Enterprises and this reactor.
MIRANDA: And to do what with it?
WAYNE: Nothing. Until we can find a way to
guarantee its safety.
72.
MIRANDA: And if we can’t?
WAYNE: Decommission it. Flood it.
MIRANDA: Destroy the world’s best chance for
a sustainable future?
WAYNE: If the world’s not ready. Yes.
MIRANDA: Bruce, if you want to save the
world you have to start trusting
it.
WAYNE: I’m trusting you.
MIRANDA: Doesn’t count. You have no choice.
WAYNE: I could’ve flooded this chamber any
time in the last three years. I’m
choosing to trust you, Miranda, and
that’s not the easiest thing for
me. Please.
His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.
FOX: We have a board meeting to get to.

INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - DAY

The Board Members, including Daggett and Miranda, take their
seats. Fox at one end of the table, Wayne at the other.
DAGGETT: I’d like to point out that we have
a non-board member here. Highly
irregular, even if it is his family
name above the door...
All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up.
FREDERICKS: Bruce Wayne’s family built this
company -
73.
BOARD MEMBER 2: And he himself has run it -
DAGGETT: Into the ground, sir. Anybody
disagree? Check the value of your
shares this morning. Gambling on
crazy futures didn’t just lose Mr.
Wayne his seat, it’s lost us all a
lot of money. He needs to leave.
FOX: I’m afraid he has a point, Mr.
Wayne.
WAYNE: I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.
Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves.
DAGGETT: Let’s get down to business.
FOX: Right away.

INT. LOBBY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS

Wayne exits the building. There is an angry mob of
Shareholders and a pack of hungry Reporters.
REPORTER: Wayne, how’s it feel to be one of
the people?!
COMPANY VALET: I’m sorry, sir, they had paperwork
-
Wayne looks over to see his Lamborghini being towed.
BLAKE (O.S.): Looks like you need a lift.
Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car. Nods.
74.

INT. DAGGETT’S PENTHOUSE - DAY

Daggett bursts in, furious. Stryver tries to placate him.
DAGGETT: How the hell did Miranda Tate get
the inside track on the Wayne
board?! Was she meeting with Wayne?
Was she sleeping with Wayne?
STRYVER: Not that we know of -
DAGGETT: Clearly you don’t ’know of’
anything, do you?! Where’s Bane?!
STRYVER: We told him it was urgent -
DAGGETT: Then where is the masked -
BANE (O.S.): Speak of the devil...
Daggett turns. Bane is already there.
BANE: ...and he shall appear.
DAGGETT: What the hell’s going on?
BANE: The plan is proceeding as expected.
DAGGETT: You see me running Wayne
Enterprises?! (Moves towards Bane.)
Your stock exchange hit didn’t
work, friend. And now you’ve got my
construction crews working all
hours around the city? How’s that
supposed to help my company absorb
Wayne’s?
BANE: (to Stryver)
Leave us.
75.
DAGGETT: You stay right there! I’m in
charge!
Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett’s shoulder.
BANE: Do you feel in charge?
Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.
DAGGETT: I’ve paid you a small fortune -
BANE: And that gives you power over me?
Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder. Nervous.
DAGGETT: What is this?
BANE: Your money and infrastructure have
been important. Till now.
DAGGETT: What are you?
BANE: Gotham’s reckoning. Come to end the
borrowed time you’ve all been
living on...
Bane gently takes the terrified Daggett’s head in his
hands...
DAGGETT: You are true evil...
BANE: I am necessary evil.
Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches.
SCENE OMITTED: 76.

INT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

Wayne stares out the window. Blake glances across.
BLAKE: When you began...why the mask?
WAYNE: To protect the people closest to
me.
BLAKE: You’re a loner with no family.
WAYNE: There are always people you care
about. You just don’t realize how
much until they’re gone. (Collects
himself.) The idea was to be a
symbol. Batman could be anybody,
that was the point.
BLAKE: It was damn good to see him back.
WAYNE: Not everybody agrees.
BLAKE: They’ll figure it out in the end.
WAYNE: Got anything on Bane’s whereabouts?
BLAKE: Yeah, I’ve got five hundred pages
of tunnel records and a flashlight.
I could use some help.
WAYNE: (thinks)
You know what? Drop me in Old
Town...

EXT. SELINA’S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - DAY

Blake drops Wayne off.
WAYNE: Don’t wait. I’ll get a cab.
77.
BLAKE: You got money?
WAYNE: (smiles, sheepish)
Actually, no.
Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street.
The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off.

INT. SELINA’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Selina is packing a bag. She hears voices in the stairwell.
JEN (O.S.): I told you, money first.
WAYNE (O.S.): I don’t think so.

INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Selina finds Wayne standing there with Jen.
SELINA: He’s not a mark.
Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne.
SELINA: And he doesn’t have a cent to his
name, anyway.

INT. SELINA’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Wayne looks at the cramped space. Selina shifts,
embarrassed.
SELINA: Yeah, it’s not much. (Smiles.) But
it’s more that you’ve got right
now.
WAYNE: Actually, they’re letting me keep
the house.
SELINA: (shakes head)
The rich don’t even go broke same
as the rest of us, huh?
78.
WAYNE: (spots her bag)
Vacation?
SELINA: Let’s just say that I’ve incurred
the wrath of some people less
susceptible to my charms than you.
WAYNE: My powerful friend hopes to change
your mind about leaving.
SELINA: And how would he do that?
WAYNE: By giving you what you want.
SELINA: It doesn’t exist.
WAYNE: He says it does. He wants to meet.
Tonight.
SELINA: Why?
WAYNE: He needs to find Bane. He thinks
you’d know how.
SELINA: Tell him I’ll think about it.
Wayne nods, starts to leave.
SELINA: Mr. Wayne? I’m sorry they took all
your money.
WAYNE: No, you’re not.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Blake moves through the hospital corridor, looking for -
79.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Blake enters. Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley.
FOLEY: Can we help you, officer?
BLAKE: John Daggett’s body was found in a
dumpster an hour ago. I thought you
might like to know.
GORDON: Why?
BLAKE: Because Daggett’s name is all over
the permits I pulled to map the
tunnels under Gotham.
Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.
BLAKE: MTA maintenance, sewer
construction...
GORDON: (to Foley)
Where did you get to with the
tunnel searches?
FOLEY: (to Blake)
Remind me to tell the detail to
keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.)
We’ve had teams down there, but
it’s a huge network -
GORDON: Get more men, work a grid. I want
him found.
FOLEY: Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We’re
on it.
Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake.
GORDON: This is good work. Lose the uniform
- you’re working for me now. We
could use some hotter heads around
here.
80.
BLAKE: This could just be a coincidence.
GORDON: You’re a detective now, son, you’re
not allowed to believe in
coincidence anymore.
Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - EVENING (END OF DAY)

Wayne, covering his head with a newspaper, hurries up the
driveway in the rain. Steps into the alcove. Hits the bell.
MIRANDA (O.S): Nobody’s answering.
Wayne turns to find Miranda there.
WAYNE: No. I’m on my own now.
MIRANDA: Do you have keys?
Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden.
WAYNE: Never needed them...
She takes his hand.
MIRANDA: Let’s find a window.

INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (END OF DAY)

They force the French windows - enter, brushing off the
rain.
MIRANDA: Fox worked the board like you’ve
never seen - I’m in, Daggett’s out
and he’s not happy.
Wayne sets down the newspaper: FROM BILLIONAIRE TO BUM
81.
WAYNE: Hope you don’t like me for your
money.
Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.
MIRANDA: Suffering builds character.
Then at a photo of Wayne’s parents.
MIRANDA: I’ll take care of your parents’
legacy, Bruce.
Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel.
MIRANDA: Who’s this?
Wayne looks at her. Can’t find words...
MIRANDA: Where’s Alfred?
WAYNE: He left. Taking everything.
Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then
again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.
MIRANDA: What’s that?
WAYNE: (sheepish)
I think my power’s been shut off.

INT. SAME - LATER (NIGHT)

Wayne watches as Miranda tends to a roaring fire.
WAYNE: You’re pretty good at that.
MIRANDA: When I was a child we had almost
nothing. But on the nights we had a
fire, we felt very rich indeed.
She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them.
82.
WAYNE: I assumed your family was wealthy.
MIRANDA: Not always. Not when I was young.
He traces a scar on her shoulder.
MIRANDA: An old mistake.
WAYNE: I’ve made a few myself.
She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.
MIRANDA: More than a few... (Smiles.) We
could leave. Tonight. Take my
plane. Go anywhere we wanted.
WAYNE: Someday perhaps. Not tonight.
She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each
other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room.

INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

Miranda is sleeping, wrapped in the blanket. Wayne studies
her for a moment, then slips out...

INT. BATCAVE - MOMENTS LATER

Wayne moves to the Batsuit. Picks up the cowl.

EXT. SKIES ABOVE GOTHAM - NIGHT

The Bat roars towards downtown. Batman kills the lights and
main engines - the Bat quietly autorotates into the canyons.

INT. MIA TUNNEL - LATER

Catwoman on a wall, watching trains go by. She senses...
CATWOMAN: Don’t be shy.
...Batman is there.
83.
CATWOMAN: Wayne says you can get me the
’Clean Slate’.
BATMAN: That depends.
CATWOMAN: On what?
BATMAN: On what you want it for. I acquired
it to keep it out of the wrong
hands.
CATWOMAN: Still don’t trust me, huh? How can
we change that?
BATMAN: Start by taking me to Bane.
CATWOMAN: (shrugs)
You asked.
Catwoman jumps down. Batman follows. Catwoman leads him down
into a service tunnel...

INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Catwoman speaks over her shoulder as she walks.
CATWOMAN: From here, Bane’s men patrol the
tunnels...and they are not your
average brawlers.
BATMAN: Neither am I.
Catwoman swings into a -

INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

A Mercenary patrols. Catwoman comes up behind.
CATWOMAN: He’s behind you.
84.
MERCENARY: (spins)
Who?
Batman hangs upside down behind him.
BATMAN (O.S.): Me.
Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel.
Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked
off his feet by darkness - he screams...
Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo...
Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel.
CATWOMAN: Just a little further.
A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He
is deep inside.

INT. BANE’S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

Mercenaries look down on him from above. Catwoman turns.
CATWOMAN: I had to find a way to stop them
trying to kill me.
BATMAN: You’ve made a serious mistake.
BANE (O.S.): Not as serious as yours, I fear.
Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls.
BATMAN: Bane.
BANE: Let’s not stand on ceremony here,
Mr. Wayne.
Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she’s done.
Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches
his fist.
BANE: Peace has cost you strength.
Victory has defeated you.
85.
Bane SMASHES Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk -
Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a
chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls
flashbangs at Bane, who doesn’t flinch.
BANE: Theatricality and deception are
powerful agents...to the
uninitiated.
Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.
BANE: But we are initiated, aren’t we,
Bruce? The League of Shadows. And
you betrayed us...
BATMAN: Us? You were excommunicated. From a
gang of psychopaths.
BANE: Now I am the Legue of Shadows, here
to fulfill R¯a’s al Gh¯ul’s
destiny...
Batman hurls himself at bane, throwing his into the
waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into
Bane’s mask again and again, water cascading over them.
Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses.
Bane’s arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES...
BANE: You fight like a younger man.
Nothing held back. No reserves.
Admirable. But mistaken.
Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane
turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once.
BANE: You think darkness is your ally.
But you merely adopted the dark. I
was born in it. Formed by it...
In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike...
BANE: I didn’t see the light until I was
already a man. And by then it was
nothing to me but blinding...
86.
Bane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman’s throat in
his grasp.
BANE: The shadows betray you, because
they belong to me...
Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding,
pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS.
Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the
chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes...
BANE: I will show you where I’ve made my
home while preparing to bring
justice. Then...I will break you.
A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through
cracked cowl - Bane hits the detonator - explosions BURST
over his head as the ceiling CRUMBLES revealing: Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox’s
weapons store...a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble.
BATMAN: No...
BANE: Your precious armory. Gratefully
accepted. We will need it.

INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - CONTINUOUS

Mercenaries race through the stacks of equipment...

INT. BANE’S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

Batman climbs to his feet, swaying. Bane approaches.
BANE: I wondered which would break first
- your spirit...
Batman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him
HIGH.: ...or your body.
Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back
with a horrific CRACK.
87.
In the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to
pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift
Wayne’s body and carry him off... Bane stares into the
hollow eyes of his trophy...
Catwoman slinks back into the shadows, and we -
FADE TO BLACK.:
FADE IN::

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

Blake’s cruiser pulls up. He noses up to the windows.
Nothing.

EXT. SELINA’S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - DAY

Blake sits in his cruiser. Selina exits, wide-brimmed hat,
bags. Blake recognizes her. She hails a cab.
BLAKE: (into radio)
Get Commissioner Gordon. Tell him
I’ve got a line on the
Congressman’s kidnapping.
Blake pulls out to follow.

INT. TERMINAL, GOTHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

Selina moves through the terminal. She clocks a Uniform Cop
staring at her - ducks down a service hallway.

INT. SERVICE HALLWAY, AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

The Uniform rounds the corner to find Selina applying
make-up.
UNIFORM: Excuse me, Miss. I need to see your
ticket and identification, please.
Selina, surprised, fumbles with her purse.
SELINA: Would you mind?
88.
She hands the Uniform her had - punches him through the
brim, stuffs him in a closet - plants her mangled hat on his
head.

INT. JETWAY, AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

Selina makes her way down the jetway - spots Security at the
far end - turns - Blake smiles at her. Badge in hand.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, AIRPORT - DAY

Selina, now in cuffs, looks up as Blake walks in.
BLAKE: I showed your picture to the
Congressman and guess what?
SELINA: Don’t tell me, still in love?
BLAKE: Head over heels. Pressing charges,
though.
Blake lays a police file down with a thump.
You’ve made some mistakes, Ms.
Kyle.
SELINA: Girl’s gonna eat.
BLAKE: You have an appetite. Why run? You
can’t hide from us with this
record.
SELINA: Maybe it’s not you I’m running
from.
BLAKE: Who then? Bane? What do you know
about him?
SELINA: (quiet)
That you should be as afraid of him
as I am.
89.
BLAKE: We can offer you protection...
Selina looks at him with contempt. Blake shrugs, switches
off the tape, moves to the door.
BLAKE: When I spotted you, I was looking
for a friend...Bruce Wayne.
Selina turns to look at Blake. His eyes plead with her.
BLAKE: Did the kill him?
SELINA: I’m not sure.
And we -
CUT TO:: BLACK SCREEN. Sounds: screaming, laughing, CRYING. Sights: LIGHT, bodies FALLING, a DARK SKULL... And we are -

INT. STONE CELL - DAWN

Wayne opens his eyes. Unshaven. Filthy. Someone else is in
the cell - Wayne cannot move to look - even the attempt is
painful...the skull drifts into his sight. Bane. Squatting
at Wayne’s bedside, muscled shoulders curving into his mask.
WAYNE: Why didn’t you just kill me?
BANE: You don’t fear death. You welcome
it. Your punishment is to be more
severe.
WAYNE: (scathing)
You’re a torturer...
BANE: Yes. But not of your body. Of your
soul.
Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain.
90.
WAYNE: Where am I?
BANE: Home.
Wayne’s eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant
sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison.
Where I learned the truth about
despair. As will you. (Rises.)
There is a reason that this prison
is the worst hell on earth...
Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five
hundred feet above. Like being at the bottom of a gigantic
well...
Hope. Every man who has rotted here
over the centuries has looked up to
the light and imagined climbing to
freedom. So simple. So easy. And,
like shipwrecked men turning to sea
water from uncontrollable thirst,
many have died trying. I learned
that there can be no true despair
without hope. (Turns to Wayne.) So
as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed
its people hope to poison their
souls. I will let them believe they
can survive so that you can watch
them clamber over each other to
stay in the sun...
Bane points to an old TV, just outside the bars.
You will watch as I torture an
entire city to cause you pain you
thought you could never feel again.
Then, when you have truly
understood the depths of your
failure, we will fulfill R¯a’s al
Gh¯ul’s destiny. We will destroy
Gotham. And when it is done...when
Gotham is ashes...then you have my
permission to die.
Bane rises. Leaves. Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness.

EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - DAY

A van pulls through the gate. Selina, inside the van, looks
up at the formidable grey building.
91.

INT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

Guards lead Selina down the cells. Whistles and catcalls.
GUARD: We’re locking her up in here?
WARDEN: The Dent Act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary need. First
time she broke out of women’s
correctional she was sixteen.
Selina passes a Huge Inmate who strains through the bars...
HUGE INMATE: Little closer, baby...
SELINA: Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand?
Without breaking step, she slips his outstretched hands
between her handcuffed ones and cartwheels, snapping his
arms - he screams in agony - she keeps walking...
WARDEN: She’ll be just fine.

INT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - DAY

Fox comes out of the elevator with Miranda.
FOX: I don’t see the need for a board
meeting on the energy project -
MIRANDA: Bruce got a lot of things right.
Keeping the board in the dark
wasn’t one of them...
Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open...

INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS

The board is there. Scared. At the head of the table - Bane.
BANE: This meeting is called to order.
Fox and Miranda freeze. Staring at the mask.
92.
BANE: Chair and President. I also need
one ordinary member - Mr. Fox,
would you care to nominate?
FREDERICKS: No. I volunteer.
The dignified older board member gets to his feet.
Mercernaries round the three up.
FOX: Where are you taking us?
BANE: Where you buried your resources.
The bowels of Gotham.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Gordon, with a Nurse’s help, pulls himself to a seated
position as Blake watches.
GORDON: So you think our friend is gone
again?
BLAKE: (grave)
This time...he might not be coming
back.
Gordon takes this in...Foley bursts in, agitated.
FOLEY: Okay, Commissioner, you were tight.
GORDON: What’s happened?
FOLEY: Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne
Enterprises board. He let most of
them go, but took three down into
the sewers.
GORDON: No more patrols, no more hide and
seek. Send every available cop
down there to smoke him out.
93.
FOLEY: The Mayor won’t want panic -
BLAKE: So it’s a training exercise.
Foley looks at Gordon.
FOLEY: I’m sorry for not taking you
seriously -
GORDON: Don’t apologize for believing the
world’s in better shape then it
is...just fight to make it true.
Foley nods. Leaves. Blake gets up.
GORDON: Not you. You’re telling me the
Batman’s gone. So you chase up the
Daggett leads, any way you can.
Blake nods.

INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

Wayne lies, weak, feverish. A Prisoner drips water onto his
parched lips. An elderly Blind Prisoner squatting by the
wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue.
PRISONER: He asks if you would pay us to let
you die. I told him you have
nothing.
WAYNE: Do it for the pleasure.
The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne’s lips.
PRISONER: They pay me more than that to keep
you alive.
A chant gets Wayne’s attention. He rolls his head painfully
to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong
Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other
Prisoners.
94.
PRISONER: He will try the climb.
String Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners’ chant
grows stronger as he climbs towards the light.
Above: Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve-foot
leap from the rest of the climb... The chanting peaks as
Strong Man leaps...misses...falls. The rope catches - he
swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong
Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor.
WAYNE: Has anyone made it?
PRISONER: Of course not.
The Blind Prisoner barks at him.
WAYNE: What does he say?
PRISONER: He says there is one who did. A
child...
INSERT CUT: a child of about ten looks up towards the light.
PRISONER: A child who had been born in this
hell...
WAYNE: Bane.
PRISONER: An old legend. Nothing more.
The Prisoner leaves Wayne’s cell - switches on the TV.
WAYNE: Don’t.
PRISONER: Whatever they want you to
see...it’s happening soon.

charges on a hewn wall. Dr. Pavel is here. Waiting. Bane
nods at his men. The wall blows.

EXT. LOCATIONS AROUND GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS

Bane leads the way over rubble into the REACTOR. Dr. Pavel
follows. Bane approaches the machine. Turns to Fox.

BANE: I only need one other board member.
There are eight more waiting
upstairs.
FOX: I won’t do it.
Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.
MIRANDA: Alright, stop.
She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It
beeps. She turns to Fox. Quietly pleading.
96.
MIRANDA: Lucius, you’ll kill this man and
yourself, and barely slow them
down.
Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then
Fredericks. The core glows brighter and brighter. Dr. Pavel
is transfixed.
BANE: Do your work.
Bane turns to his men. Gestures at the hostages.
Take them to the surface. People of
their status deserve to see the
next era of western civilization.
Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble.

EXT. GOTHAM STADIUM - DAY

The Mayor, flanked by Security, talks to a crowd of
Reporters.

BLAKE: I’ve been to half Daggett’s cement
plants, logged locations they’ve
poured for underground
construction...
97.
GORDON (O.S.): Anything strange about the
pourings?
Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations.
BLAKE: Honestly, Commissioner, I don’t
know anything about civil
engineering.

looking.
Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant.

Dr. Pavel finishes his work. Turns to Bane. Grave.
DR. PAVEL: It’s done. This is now a
four-megaton nuclear bomb.
BANE: (to his men)
Pull the core out of the reactor.
DR. PAVEL: (horrified)
You can’t. This is the only power
source capable of sustaning it - if
you move it, the core will decay in
a matter of months.
BANE: Five, by my calculations.
DR. PAVEL: And then it will go off.
BANE: For the sake of your family, Dr.
Pavel, I hope so.
Dr. Pavel stares as Mercenaries start to disconnect the
core...
98.

EXT. CEMENT PLANT - CONTINUOUS

Blake is led through a fence by a Worker.
WORKER: Boss is about to leave.
Blake walks past cement mixers. Spots someone. A Driver.
BLAKE: Hey.
The Driver turns.
BLAKE: That was you outside the stock
exchange, right?
DRIVER: When?
BLAKE: When? When half the city’s cops
were trying to pull onto Castle
Street and your truck shut them
out.
DRIVER: Oh yeah. You’re that cop -
BLAKE: Detective, now.
Behind Blake the Worker puts his hand is his pocket...
BLAKE: And as a detective...I’m not
allowed to believe in coincidences
anymore -
Blake spins, drawing his weapon. The Worker lunges with a
knife, Blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him.
The Driver grabs him from behind. Blake wrestles, but the
Driver is string, trained. Blake can’t aim his gun, he fires
behind, into a steel mixer - the bullets ricochet, one
catches the Driver in the back and he goes down... Blake,
gasping, kneels beside the Driver.
BLAKE: What were you doing?! What?!
The man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses
is down. Pulls out his phone. Dials.
99.
BLAKE: Commissioner, I’m at the Fourteenth
Street plant with two dead
witnesses and a lot of questions.
Call me -
Blake freezes, stooped to pick up his gun. Looking at some
empty barrels...
Commissioner, they’ve got
Polyisobutylene here... (Looks
around.) And motor oil. They
weren’t making cement, they were
making explosives -

cops underground!
Foley looks up with dread at the mouth of the tunnel.
FOLEY: Pull out! Pull ’em out!

F-22’s streak over the river, sizing up the island.

EXT. GOTHAM STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

Bane rests his powerful hand on Dr. Pavel’s shoulder.
BANE: Tell the world what this is.
DR. PAVEL: A fully primed neutron bomb. With a
blast radius of six miles.
BANE: And who can disarm this device?
DR. PAVEL: Only me.
BANE: Thank you, Doctor.
Bane snaps Dr. Pavel’s neck in front of the world.
BANE: The bomb is armed, the bomb is
mobile, the identity of the
triggerman is a mystery. One of you
holds the detonator - we come not
as conquerors, but as liberators to
return control of this city to the
people. At the first sign of
interference from the outside world
or of people attempting to flee,
this anonymous Gothamite, this
unsung hero, will trigger the bomb.
For now, martial law is in effect.
Return to your homes, hold your
families close, and wait. Tomorrow

detonating our device. Send an
emissary to discuss terms of access
for supplies and communication.
A Captain steps forward, walks to the apex of the bridge.
CAPTAIN: How many of you are there, son?
(Nothing.) You don’t have enough
men to stop twelve million people
leaving that island.
LEAD MERCENARY: We don’t. But you do.
CAPTAIN: Why in the hell would we help you
keep your hostages?
LEAD MERCENARY: If people start crossing this
bridge Gotham gets blown to hell.
The Captain considers this. Troubled.

EXT. SKIES ABOVE GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS

As night falls the F-22’s peel away from the fire-ringed

PRESIDENT: (over radio)
As the situation develops, one
thing must be understood above all
others... People of Gotham, we have
not abandoned you.
BLAKE: What does that mean?
GORDON: It means we’re on our own. I have
to get in front of a camera -
BLAKE: Sir, they’ll kill you the second
you show your face -
GORDON: The Mayor’s dead. I’m the symbol of
law and order. Bane says he’s
giving Gotham back to the people -
they need to know that I could
lead.

The Prisoners start cheering, shouting.
BANE (O.S.): ...and rebuilding it the way it
should have been rebuilt
generations ago...

Harvey Dent. In the words of
Gotham’s Police Commissioner, James
Gordon...

INT. BLAKE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

This gets Blake’s attention. Gordon watches, uneasy...

EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

Bane unfolds the pages of Gordon’s undelivered speech...
BANE: ’The truth about Harvey Dent is
simple in only one regard - it has
been hidden for too long. After his
devastating injuries, Harvey’s mind
has recovered no better than his
mutilated face. He was a broken,
dangerous man, not the crusader for
justice that I, James Gordon, have
portrayed him to be for the last
eight years. Harvey’s rage was
indiscriminate. Psychopathic. He
held my family at gunpoint, then
fell to his death in the struggle
over my son’s life. The Batman did
not murder Harvey Dent - he saved
(MORE): 109.
BANE (cont’d)
my boy. Then took the blame for
Harvey’s appalling crimes, so that
I could, to my shame, build a lie
around this fallen idol.’

INT. BLAKE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Blake stares at the TV, Gordon’s face lowers into his
hands...
BANE (V.O.): ’I praised the madman who tried to
murder my own child.’

EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

The crowd is silent, stunned, as Bane continues to read.
BANE: ’The things we did in Harvey’s name
brought desperately needed security
to our streets... But I can no
longer live with my lie. It is time
to trust the people of Gotham with
the truth, and it is time for me to
resign.’
Bane folds the papers. Looks out to the stunned crowd.
Do you accept this man’s
resignation?
Individuals in the crows start shouting ’Yes!’

INT. CELLBLOCK, BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

Prisoners cheer, pounding against the bars. Selina
watches...

EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

BANE: Do you accept the resignation of
all the liars?! All the corrupt?!
More and more of the crowd is chanting ’Yes!’
110.

INT. BLAKE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Blake turns to Gordon, who stares at the TV.
BLAKE: These men, locked up in Blackgate
for eight years, denied parole
under the Dent Act. Based on a lie.
GORDON: A lie to keep a city from burning
to the ground. Gotham needed a
hero, someone to believe in -
BLAKE: Not as much as it does now. But you
betrayed everything you stood for.
GORDON: (looks at Blake)
There’s a point. Far out there.
When the structures fail you. When
the rules aren’t weapons anymore,
they’re shackles, letting the bad
get ahead. Maybe one day you’ll
have such a moment of crisis. And
in that moment, I hope you have a
friend like I did. To plunge their
hands into the filth so you can
keep yours clean.
BLAKE: Your hands look pretty filthy to
me, Commissioner.
Gordon stares at him. Blake goes back to packing.

EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

Bane signals a Tumbler - its turret turns to the prison
doors.
BANE: We take Gotham from the corrupt.
The rich. The oppressors of
generations who’ve kept you down
with the myth of opportunity. And
we give it to you, the people.
Gotham is yours - none shall
interfere. Do as you please...
The Tumbler fires, blowing the doors to hell.
(MORE): 111.
BANE (cont’d)
But start by storming Blackgate and
freeing the oppressed... Step
forward, those who would serve...
Bane’s men surge through the burning gates...

INT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

She makes her way quietly through the excited throng.
BANE (V.O.): For an army will be raised...

INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

Wayne rolls of his cot. Grunts. The Prisoner realizes Wayne
is trying to do a push-up. From the next cell, the Blind
Prisoner says something...
PRISONER: He says you must first straighten
your back.
The Prisoner helps Wayne roll over, painfully.
113.
WAYNE: How would he know?
PRISONER: He was the prison doctor. A
morphine addict who incurred the
displeasure of powerful people.
Including your masked friend.
WAYNE: How?
PRISONER: Many years ago, during a time of
plague, Bane was attacked by other
prisoners. The doctor’s fumbling
attempts to repair the damage left
him in perpetual agony. The mask
holds his pain at bay.
WAYNE: Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was
he born here?
PRISONER: The legens is that there was a
mercenary working for the local
warlord who fell in love with his
daughter. They married in secret.
The Prisoner takes a rope - ties it under Wayne’s arms.
PRISONER: When the warlord found out, he
condemned the mercenary to this
pit. But then exiled him instead.
INSERT CUT: the Mercenary is dropped at the side of a barren
road. He starts to walk.
PRISONER: The mercenary understood that the
warlord’s daughter had secured his
release, but he couldn’t know the
true price of his freedom. She had
taken his place in the pit.
INSERT CUT: a Woman is lowered into the prison. The
prisoners below all have their faces covered with muslin
masks...
114.
PRISONER: And she was with the child. The
mercenary’s child.
INSERT CUT: the Woman watches as the Doctor, (the Blind
Prisoner, younger-looking, sighted) examines her small
child. The Doctor exits, locking the cell...
PRISONER: One day the doctor forgot the lock
the cell...
INSERT CUT: Prisoners move into the cell towards his mother.
The child runs at them with a knife...
PRISONER: Innocence cannot flower
underground. It was to be stamped
out. But the child had a friend. A
protector...
INSERT CUT: the Protector, face covered, pulls the Child off
the attackers. One grabs for the Child - the Protector snaps
his arm, carries the Child into a corner...
PRISONER: ...who showed the other that this
innocence was their redemption. The
mother was not so lucky.
The Blind Prisoner shouts at the Prisoner. He nods.
PRISONER: This is Bane’s prison now. Bane
would not want this story told.
The Prisoner pulls - Wayne screams in pain as he is pulled
upright. The Prisoner ties him off. Checks his spine.
You have a protruding
vertebra...I’m going to force it
back...
WAYNE: How -?
The Prisoner punches Wayne in the back, hard. Wayne screams.
PRISONER: You stay like this. Until you
stand.
Wayne passes out from the pain and we FADE TO BLACK.
Wayne is hanging in his cell, delirious.
115.
R¯A’S AL GH¯UL (O.S.)
Did you not think I’d return,
Bruce?
R¯a’s al Gh¯ul, in his Ducard guise, steps in front of Wayne.
R¯A’S AL GH¯UL: I told you I was immortal.
WAYNE: I watched you die.
R¯A’S AL GH¯UL: There are many forms of
immortality.
Wayne looks inward, remembering...
INSERT CUT: R¯a’s at the campfire (from Batman Begins).
R¯A’S AL GH¯UL: Once I had a wife. My great love.
She was taken from me...
INSERT CUT: the Woman is lowered into the prison...
Wayne looks at R¯a’s.
WAYNE: You were the mercenary. Bane is
your child. Your heir.
INSERT CUT: the Mercenary at the side of the road. R¯a’s.
R¯A’S AL GH¯UL: An heir to ensure the League of
Shadows fulfills its duty to
restore balance to civilization.
WAYNE: No...
R¯A’S AL GH¯UL: You yourself fought the decadence
of Gotham for years. With all your
strength and resources, all your
moral authority. And the only
victory you could achieve was a
lie. Finally you
understand...Gotham is beyond
saving...
116.
WAYNE:
NO!:
R¯A’S AL GH¯UL: And must be allowed to die.
CUT TO WHITE. And we are -

FATHER REILLY: Really?
BLAKE: (grins)
How do you think I got it?

BLAKE: Less you know, Father. How’re the
boys?
117.
FATHER REILLY: Power’s been on more, so they get

Blake, you be careful out there.

Blake nods. Leaves.

PRISONER: Here? There? What’s the difference?
Wayne ignores this. Focuses on his body...

INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

Wayne moves to the wall - takes the rope from the Tattooed
Prisoner, wraps it around his chest. Curious Prisoners
gather, the Prisoner at their head. Wayne looks up at the
light, hundreds of feet above. Starts to climb. Prisoners
get excited as Wayne RISES - money starts exchanging hands.
Reaching the precipice, he checks his rope, looks up at the
next handhold, far away. He takes a breath, then LEAPS.
His fingers brush the ledge. Wayne DROPS a hundred feet -
the rope catches, SLAMMING him into the rock face. The
Prisoners disperse, losing interest as the Tattooed Prisoner
lowers Wayne on the rope. The Blind Prisoner turns away.
PRISONER: I told you it could not be done.
WAYNE: You told me a child did it...
PRISONER: No ordinary child...
INSERT CUT: the Protector fights off prisoners as the Child,
older now, moves to the climbing wall
A child born in hell.
INSERT CUT: the Child makes the climb...pauses, looking down
- making eye-contact with the Protector, who fights off
Prisoners... They swarm over the Protector, knives drawn.
A child forged by suffering,
hardened by pain...
INSERT CUT: the Child leaps across the abyss, grabbing a
handhold on the ledge and swinging up...
Not a man from privilege.
Wayne’s eyes close in despair.

CAPTAIN JONES: How many of you are there?
GORDON: Dozens. I’d rather not say exactly.
But the men trapped underground
number almost three thousand.
CAPTAIN JONES: What kind of shape they’re in?
GORDON: They’ve been getting water, food.
CAPTAIN JONES: Could we break them out?
BLAKE: Yes, sir - take out the mercenaries
guarding the outflow south of
Ackerman Park, blow the rubble,
you’ve got a hole big enough for
ten at a time. I’m in contact with
my partner - they’re waiting for
the day.
SPECIAL FORCES 2: Men who haven’t seen daylight for
three months?
BLAKE: Men with automatic weapons who
haven’t seen daylight in three
months.
CAPTAIN JONES: What about the bomb? The satellites
can’t see any radiation hot
spots...

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY

Blake scouts with Jones. A rumble makes them turn.
GORDON (V.O.): They keep it on a truck - it must
have a lead-lined roof. They move
it constantly.
CAPTAIN JONES (V.O.): But you know the truck?
121.
GORDON (V.O.): They’ve got three of them. The
routes don’t vary much.
Two Tumblers lead a massive black truck down the street.
Captain Jones reaches into his jacket and triggers a Geiger
counter. Shows Blake the display. Nods. One of the Tumblers
stops, turns back. Blake leads them down a side street.

INT. LOWER STOREROOM - CONTINUOUS

CAPTAIN JONES: What about the triggerman?
GORDON: No leads. It’s a bluff - Bane
wouldn’t give control of that bomb
to someone else.
CAPTAIN JONES: We can’t take that chance. Until we
have the triggerman, we just track
the device, smuggle men over -
BLAKE: While Gotham lives under a warlord,
like in some failed state?
CAPTAIN JONES: Dial it back, officer. This
situation is unprecedented. We
can’t do anything to risk millions
of lives.
BLAKE: (to Gordon)
Aren’t you gonna tell him?!
GORDON: Captain, things are more
complicated than you think. There’s
somebody you need to meet. Blake?
Blake nods, leads Jones and his men up the stairs.

EXT. SIDE STREET, DOWNTOWN - CONTINUOUS

Blake leads them to the door of an empty bank.
122.

INT. TELLSONS BANK - CONTINUOUS

They head across the empty lobby to an elevator.

INT. OFFICES ABOVE TELLSONS - MOMENTS LATER

Blake leads them into empty offices. Cots and makeshift
furnishings line the offices and corridors.
BLAKE: I was up here looking for a vantage
point. Found the people who run the
corporation who owns it living
here.
CAPTAIN JONES: Which corporation?
FOX (O.S.): Wayne Enterprises.
Lucius Fox is there, with Miranda Tate.
BLAKE: Captain, meet Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox, I’d
like you to brief the Captain.
Captain Jones indicates Miranda.
FOX: Miss Tate is fully aware of the
situation.
MIRANDA: And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I
have to take responsibility for it.
CAPTAIN JONES: Why?
MIRANDA: Because, Captain, we built it.
CAPTAIN JONES: You built the bomb?
FOX: It was built as a fusion reactor.
The first of its kind. Bane turned
the core into a bomb, then
disconnected it from the reactor.
123.
BLAKE: And here’s the important part.
FOX: As the device’s fuel cells decay,
it’s becoming increasingly
unstable...until the point of
detonation.
BLAKE: The bomb’s a time bomb.
FOX: And it will go off. In twenty-three
days.
Captain Jones reels at this news.
BLAKE: Bane’s revolution is a sham. He’s
watching Gotham rearrange its
deckchairs while the whole ship’s
going down. Your appeasement plan
might not be as practical as you
thought.
Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.
CAPTAIN JONES: Could you disarm it?
FOX: I don’t know, But I could reconnect
it to the reactor. Stabilize it.
CAPTAIN JONES: We’d have to let the Pentagon know.
SPECIAL FORCES 2: They’ll be monitoring our
frequencies -
CAPTAIN JONES: We have no choice. Let’s move away
from this location, then call it
in.
124.

INT. TELLSONS BANK - MOMENTS LATER

Captain Jones exits the elevator, followed by his men and
Blake. Halfway across the floor, hell breaks loose.
Mercenaries blast them with machine guns - the lobby becomes
a devastating ambush. Blake dives back into the elevator.

INT. OFFICES ABOVE TELLSONS - CONTINUOUS

Blake flies out of the elevator.
BLAKE: Fox, somebody sold us out!
Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor.
FOX: Take Miranda -
Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs. Mercenaries
jump out of the elevator, firing high.
MERCERNARY: DOWN ON THE FLOOR!
Fox freezes. Lowers himself to the ground.

INT. TELLSONS BANK - CONTINUOUS

Captain Jones goes down in a hail of bullets. The other
Special Forces Men are down. Bane enters, midges Jones with
his toe. He is alive. Barely. Bane leans in close. Jones
looks up at him, defiant.
CAPTAIN JONES: I’ll die before I talk...
BANE: I’m on your schedule, Captain.
Bane places his hand over Jones’s nose and mouth.
MERCERNARY: There were people living upstairs.
Bane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead.
BANE: Give them over for judgement.
(Indicates bodies.) Hang them where
the world will see.
125.

INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

Wayne stares at the TV: the Special Forces bodies hang in
the cables of Gotham Bridge. Wayne throws a stone into the
screen.

INT. SAME - LATER

Wayne does endless push-ups, squats, stretches. The Blind
Prisoner listens. He speaks in an ancient tongue.
PRISONER: He says the leap to freedom is not
about strength.
WAYNE: My body makes the jump.
BLIND PRISONER: (cracked English)
Survival is the spirit. The soul.
WAYNE: My soul’s as ready to escape as my
body.
BLIND PRISONER: Fear is why you fail.
WAYNE: I’m not afraid. I’m angry.
Wayne throws punches...focused.

INT. UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

Wayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb. Prisoners
look up, but none bother to gather round. Wayne starts
climbing, determined.
He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock -
it comes away in his hand. He DROPS - SMASHES into the rock
face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head.
A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up
at Wayne, hanging upside down.
SKINNY PRISONER: Shouldn’t you get him down?
The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful.
126.
PRISONER: He’ll keep.
As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we -
INSERT CUT: Young Bruce lies at the bottom of the well,
looking up at his father, lowering down to rescue him.
THOMAS WAYNE (V.O.): And why do we fall?

INT. CAVE PRISON - NIGHT

Wayne wakes with a start - the Blind Prisoner is there.
BLIND PRISONER: (cracked English)
You do not fear death. You think
this makes you strong. This makes
you weak.
WAYNE: Why?
BLIND PRISONER: How can you move faster then
possible? Fight longer than
possible? If not from the most
powerful impulse of the spirit. The
fear of death. The will to survive.
Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner.
WAYNE: I do fear death. I fear dying in
here while my city burns with no
one there to save it.
BLIND PRISONER: Then make the climb.
WAYNE: How?
BLIND PRISONER: As the child did. Without the rope.
(Dry laugh.) Then fear will find
you again.
Wayne considers this.
127.

INT. CAVE PRISON - MORNING

Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he
folds into a makeshift shoulder pack.
PRISONER: Supplies for your journey?
Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The
Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne’s new demeanor. The
Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts
to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne
makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down
below the Prisoners start a low chant.
As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something
EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They
circle up to the opening above...
Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a
breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up
again...then he jumps.
Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing.
And Wayne GRABS the ledge above.
The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the
ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM.

EXT. CAVE PRISON, NEAR A FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

Wayne climbs out of the hole and into formidable desolation.
He shoulders his pack - spots a large coil of rope attached
to the wall. He pushes it into the hole then walks away...

INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

A mass of huddled Gothamites. Professionals (traders,
industrialists). In a corner, Fox. Mercenaries come down
into the chamber, pull out a man, who starts yelling. It is
Stryver, Daggett’s functionary.
STRYVER: I want to see Bane! There’s been a
mistake! Take me to Bane!
Fox watches him dragged upstairs...
128.

INT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - MOMENTS LATER

A kangaroo court. Stryver is dragged before a jeering crowd.
STRYVER: There’s been a mistake! Where’s
Bane?!
VOICE (O.S.): There’s been no mistake, Mr.
Stryver.
Stryver turns to look at the ’judge’: Dr. Jonathan Crane.
CRANE: You are Philip Stryver, executive
vice-president of Daggett
Industries? (Off nod from Stryver.)
The same Philip Stryver who for
years lived like a prince off the
blood and sweat of people less
powerful?
STRYVER: Call Bane! I’m one of you!
Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane.
CRANE: Bane has no authority here. This is
merely a sentencing hearing. The
choice is yours, death or exile.
Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts
’Death’.
STRYVER: Exile.
CRANE: (smashes gavel)
Sold...to the man in the cold
sweat!
Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock...

EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - DAY

Stryver, with other wealthy Gothamites, is led down to the
ice. A Blackgate Inmate undoes his handcuffs, whispering.
129.
BLACKGATE INMATE: Follow the tick ice. Try to swim -
you’re dead in minutes.
STRYVER: Has anyone made it?
The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the
ice. He shuffles forward, listening to the creaking...
Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him.

INT. EMPTY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Gordon stands over a map of the city. A handful of Cops sit
around the room. Waiting. Gordon looks at his watch.
GORDON: Where the hell are they? It’s not
like we have a lot of time, here.
COP: How long?
GORDON: The bomb goes off tomorrow. We’ve
got about eighteen hours to do
something.
COP: To do what?
GORDON: We mark that truck. Get a GPS on
it, then we can start thinking
about how to take it down.
The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops.
Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake.
GORDON: (low)
That’s it?
Blake just looks at him. Gordon checks the faces. Realizes.
GORDON: Foley. Where’s Foley, dammit?!
Gordon heads for the door.
130.
BLAKE: You shouldn’t be out on the streets
-

EXT. FOLEY’S BROWNSTONE - DAY

Gordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone. Stabs the bell.
FOLEY’S WIFE: Jim. He’s not here -
Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her.
GORDON: You’re sending your wife to the
door when the city’s under
occupation?!
Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed.
FOLEY: Wait in the kitchen, honey.
GORDON: What did you do, bury your uniform
in the backyard?
FOLEY: Jim, you saw what they did to those
Special Forces.
GORDON: You forgotten all the years we went
out on patrol with every gangbanger
wanting to plant one as soon as our
backs were turned?
FOLEY: This is different and you know it.
These guys run the city - the
government’s done a deal with them
-
GORDON: Deal?! Bane’s got their balls in a
vice. That’s not a deal -
FOLEY: You move against Bane, the
triggerman’s gonna hit the button -
131.
GORDON: You think he’s given control of
that bomb to one of ’the people’?!
You think this is part of some
revolution? There’s one man with
his finger on the button - Bane.
FOLEY: We have to keep our heads down
until they can fix this. If you
still had family here maybe you’d -
GORDON: This only gets fixed from inside
the city, Foley. (Calmer.) Look,
I’m not asking you to walk down
Grand in your dress blues. But
we’ve got to do something before
this maniac blows us all to hell.
FOLEY: I’m sorry Jim. I gotta -
GORDON: Keep your head down? What’s that
gonna do tomorrow, when that thing
blows?
FOLEY: You don’t know that’s going to
happen.
Foley closes the door on Gordon. Gordon stands there.
MIRANDA (O.S): I hear you’re looking for men,
Commissioner.
Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her. Blake shrugs.
MIRANDA: How about me, instead?
GORDON: Miss take, I can’t ask you -
MIRANDA: My company built it.
GORDON: Bruce Wayne built it.
132.
MIRANDA: And he wanted to destroy it. It was
me who didn’t listen. Please.
Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods.
GORDON: Let’s go.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY

A Kid sprints down the deserted street, chased by two
Gangbangers. The Kid slips in the snow - the men are on him.
GANGBANGER: You steal from us, you little
bastard?
They grab the Kid’s backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an
apple, moves to hit the Kid when - SMACK! - his hand is
grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks.
Selina catches the apple.
SELINA: You boys know you can’t come into
my neighborhood without asking
politely.
Gangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him
stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off,
howling. The Kid eyes her, wary.
SELINA: Never steal anything from someone
you can’t outrun, kid.
KID: Now you’re gonna take it.
Selina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite.
SELINA: Just tax.
She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs.
WAYNE (O.S.): Pretty generous, for a thief.
Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong,
but weathered. Beard, work clothes.
133.
SELINA: You came back. I thought they’d
killed you.
WAYNE: Not yet.
SELINA: If you’re expecting an apology -
WAYNE: It wouldn’t suit you. I need your
help.
SELINA: And why would I help you?
Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket.
WAYNE: For this. The ’Clean Slate’.
SELINA: You’re gonna trust me with that?
After what I did to you?
WAYNE: I admit I felt a little let down.
But I still think there’s more to
you. In fact, I think for you -
(indicates USB) this isn’t a tool,
it’s an escape route. You want to
disappear. Start fresh.
She looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it.
SELINA: Start fresh? I can’t even get off
this island.
WAYNE: I can give you a way off. Once
you’ve gotten me to Lucius Fox. I
need you to find out where they’re
holding him. Then take me in.
SELINA: Why do you need Fox?
WAYNE: To save this city.
134.
SELINA: Who says it needs saving? Maybe I
like it this way.
WAYNE: Maybe you do. But tomorrow that
bomb’s going off.
SELINA: Get your powerful friend on the
case.
WAYNE: I’m trying. But I need Fox.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY

Gordon and his Men are in two-man teams. Gordon is walking
down the street with Miranda. He hands her a Geiger counter.
GORDON: Stay further up the block. (Points
at Men.) They’re gonna cross the
street and try and slow the truck
down. As it approaches, hit this
button. If the needle hits two
hundred - give me the signal and I
mark the truck. Okay?
BLAKE: (over radio)
Heads up.
Blake is up on a rooftop. Gordon moves down to the other end
of the block. As the truck rumbles into view, Gordon’s Men
walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the
road. The convoy barely slows. Miranda gives Gordon the
signal. As the truck comes past, he tosses a magnetic GPS
locator at the lower part of the truck...
Gordon regroups with his Men on the corner. Checks his GPS.
GORDON: Got it.
They keep moving, turning down the next street...into an
ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained.
MERCENARY: Commissioner Gordon, you’re under
arrest.
135.
GORDON: On whose authority?
MERCERNARY: The people of Gotham.
Blake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and
the other Cops being rounded up and led away...

INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

Miranda comforts a crying Woman in the corner. Thugs come
down the stairs, laughing, leading a Hooded Prisoner. They
kick him down the last step and he stumbles. Fox moves to
his aid.
BASEMENT THUG 1: Find this one a spot, he’s got a
big day tomorrow.
They dump the Hooded Man with Fox.
BASEMENT THUG 2: We all do. Ir’s not every day you
bag Bruce Wayne...
Fox hears this. Pulls the bag from Wayne’s head. Wayne nods
at him, silent. Fox nods back. The Thugs leave. Miranda
comes over.
MIRANDA: Bruce?
FOX: You picked a hell of a time to go
on vacation, Mr. Wayne.
WAYNE: How long until the core ignites?
FOX: That bomb goes off in twelve hours.
WAYNE: Unless we can connect it to the
reactor.
FOX: If you can get it there. I’ll find
a way to plug it back in.
(Indicates Miranda.) Can you get
Miranda out?
136.
WAYNE: Not tonight. I’m sorry.
MIRANDA: Do what’s necessary.
WAYNE: (to Fox)
Tonight I need you.
FOX: What for?
WAYNE: To get me back in the game.
Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.
CATWOMAN: Sorry to spoil things, boys, but
Bane wants these guys himself...
The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks
up.
WAYNE: I won’t forget about you.
MIRANDA: I know.

EXT. COLONNADE, HOLDING AREA - CONTINUOUS

The Thugs lead Wayne and Fox along the colonnade. Catwoman
spins, takes out one Thug with a heel, one with a punch to
the throat. Fox smiles as she unlocks his wrists.
FOX: I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.
CATWOMAN: He should be so lucky.
And she’s gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs.

INT. DARK SPACE - NIGHT

Lights flicker on... Wayne and Fox are in the Bat-Bunker.
137.
WAYNE: Any move I make against Bane or the
bomb - the triggerman sets it off.
FOX: They can’t be using radio or cell -
too much interference. Infrared
doesn’t have the range. It could
only be micro-burst long wave...
Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment: mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt...
WAYNE: Could you block it?
FOX: Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance
mount from the Bat. You remember
where you parked?
Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor...

INT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING (LATE DAY)

Gordon and his men on trial. Crane presides.
CRANE: The charges are espionage and
attempted sabotage... Do you have
anything to say in your defense?
GORDON: No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort
of due process is this?
CRANE: More than you give Harvey’s
prisoners, Commissioner. Your guilt
is determined, this is merely a
sentencing hearing. What’s it to
be, death or exile?
GORDON: Crane, if you think we are going
willingly out onto that ice, you’ve
got another think coming.
CRANE: Death, than?
138.
GORDON: Looks that way.
CRANE: Very well... Death... (Smiles.) By
exile.
He smashes his gavel. Bane leans in to one of his men,
indicates Miranda.
BANE: Bring her to me.

INT. STAIRWELL, SKYSCRAPER - SUNSET

Wayne bounds up the stairs. Fox follows, out of breath
LUCIUS: I think it’s time to talk about my
year-end bonus...

EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER

Fox emerges to see Wayne uncovering the Bat... As the sun
sets, Fox starts pulling apart the gun mount.
FOX: She fly pretty well?
WAYNE: Even without the autopilot...
FOX: Autopilot? That’s what you’re there
for.

EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - NIGHT

Gordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice.
A Mercenary fires his gun in the air. Gordon takes a breath,
then leads his men onto the ice...which creaks and groans...
Further out, Gordon stops - sniffs - looks down: a pool of
liquid, beside it: a flare. Gordon picks it up, puzzled.
BATMAN (O.S.): Light it up.
139.
Gordon, energized by the familiar voice, lights the flare -
jams it into the liquid, sending a trail of FIRE across the
ice - up into a building where it forms the shape of a
BAT...:

INT. FOLEY’S BROWNSTONE - CONTINUOUS

FOLEY’S KIDS: Dad! Check it out!
FOLEY’S WIFE: Honey, take a look!

BANE: Impossible...

INT. FOLEY’S BROWNSTONE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Foley yanks up the floorboards. Pull his dress blues from
their hiding place.

EXT. OUTFLOW PIPE, ACKERMAN PARK - CONTINUOUS

Mercenaries guarding the entrance see the sign. One of them
moves out to get a better look. WHAM! He is taken out by a
dark figure. The figure steps into the light - it is
Blake...

EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - CONTINUOUS

Batman hands Gordon a metal box.
140.
BATMAN: This blocks the remote detonator
signal to the bomb. Get into onto
the truck by sunrise. They might
hit the button when it starts.
GORDON: When what starts?
BATMAN: War.

EXT. OUTFLOW PIPE, ACKERMAN PARK - CONTINUOUS

Blake takes out a second Mercenary - moves over to the open
manhole. Ross emerges - nots at Blake, who helps him climb
out. BANG - Ross goes down as Blake dives for cover. Blake
is grabbed by Mercenaries. They detonate the manhole,
sealing it, prepare to execute Blake. A dark shape drops
onto the Mercenaries... Blake watches, in awe, as Batman
takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks - then it is
finished. Quiet. One of the Mercenaries moves slightly.
BLAKE: You missed a spot.
Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake.
BATMAN: If you’re working alone, wear a
mask.
BLAKE: No one cares who I am.
BATMAN: The mask is not for you. It’s to
protect the people you care about.
BLAKE: Huh. And you always seem to know
where those people are. How is
that?
BATMAN: I lost someone once. Since then I
break into their homes when they’re
sleeping and implant a tracking
device on the back of their neck.
Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses
Blake a mini-mine.
141.
BATMAN: On three - one, two, three -
They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance -
the blasts barely move any rubble.
BLAKE: No offense, but you got anything
bigger in that belt?
BATMAN: That’s to warn the men on the other
side.
Batman disappears into the shadows.
BLAKE: But how do we -?
KAABOOOM! The Bat’s cannons light up the night.
BLAKE: Okay.
Cops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but
glad to be alive and carrying guns...
BLAKE: What now?
BATMAN: All-out assault on Bane...but you
need to get the people your care
about across the bridge.
BLAKE: Why?
BATMAN: In case we fail. Lead an exodus
across the bridge. Save as many
lives as you can.
BLAKE: Don’t you need me here?
BATMAN: You’ve given me an army. Now go.
Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops.
142.
BLAKE: Thank you.
BATMAN: Don’t thank me yet.
BLAKE: I might not get a chance later.
Batman nods. Blake disappears into the night.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

Gordon checks the metal box. Puts it under his coat. Nods at
his men, hiding in the doorways. Checks his GPS...

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Batman leads Catwoman to a rusty old container. He opens it,
revealing the Bat-Pod. Catwoman’s eyes light up.
CATWOMAN: Oh, you shouldn’t have...
She hops on, feeling the controls.
BATMAN: The mid-town tunnel’s blocked by
debris, but the cannons give you
enough firepower to make a path for
people.
Catwoman marvels at the controls...
BATMAN: To start it, you -
VARROOOM!:
CATWOMAN: I got it.
BATMAN: We’ve got forty-five minutes to
save this city -
CATWOMAN: No, I’ve got forty-five minutes to
get clear of the blast radius,
because you don’t stand a chance
against these guys.
143.
BATMAN: With your help I might.
She shakes her head.
CATWOMAN: I’ll open that tunnel, then I’m
gone.
He looks at her.
BATMAN: There’s more to you than that.
She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch.
CATWOMAN: Sorry to keep letting you down.
He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring.
Come with me. Save yourself. You
don’t owe these people anymore -
you’ve given them everything...
BATMAN: Not everything. Not yet.
Batman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the
bike and takes off.

EXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - NIGHT

Catwoman tears along on the Bat-Pod. She pulls up at the
tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAWN

The army of Cops stands at the low end of the street. At the
op is Bane’s stronghold - City Hall. Men pour out of the
building, forming up into an opposing line.
A Cop wearing full dress blues steps forward. It is Foley.
The silence is eerie... The numbers look evenly matched -
until two Tumblers arrive.
VOICE: (over loudspeaker)
DISPERSE. DISPERSE OR BE FIRED
UPON.: The Cops look shaky, pale, but determined.
144.
FOLEY: There’s only one police in this
city.
He steps forward. The line follows.

Bane stands in the colonnade. Watching.
BANE: Open fire.

EXT. STREET, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS

The Tumblers FIRE into the line of Cops, THROWING men into

WHOOOSHHH. The Bat DROPS down in front of the Cops and
BLASTS both Tumblers, FLIPPING them sideways. The Bat RISES
and the cops run towards the Mercenaries, firing - until
they are close enough to fight hand-to-hand. The street is
filled with thousands of men in pitched battle.

BANE: You came back. To die with your
city.
BATMAN: No. I came back to stop you.
145.
Bane leaps at batman, smashing powerful blows into his head.
Batman ducks, weaves and smashes his fists into Bane’s side.
Someone is watching from the window of City Hall - Miranda.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

The black truck rounds the corner. Gordon signals his man in
a Greyhound bus - who pulls across the street. The truck
smashes into the bus and stops. Gordon and his men swarm in,

bomb. Wrong truck.
GORDON: That’s impossible... Come on! Cut
over to Fifth!
They sprint for the next parallel avenue...

Batman POUNDS Bane against the marble floor. Mercenaries
guarding Miranda move towards them -
BANE: Stay back. He is mine -
Bane SMASHES Batman’s head - moves in for the kill, but
Batman SMASHES Ben to the ground, RIPS sideways across the
tubes of Bane’s mask with the blades of his forearm. Bane
bellows, thrashing in AGONY. Batman holds him down with a
hand on his throat - searches him with his free hand.
BATMAN: Give me the trigger! You’d never
give it to an ordinary citizen -
Bane’s thrashing calms as he stares at batman through
pain-soaked eyes...gasping through his broken mask for
relief.
BANE: I broke you. How have you come
back?
BATMAN: You thought you were the only one
who could learn the strength to
escape?
Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.
BANE: I never escaped - R¯a’s al Gh¯ul
rescued me. That is why I mist
fulfill his plan. That is why I
must avenge his murder.
BATMAN: (confused)
The child of R¯a’s al Gh¯ul made the
climb -
MIRANDA (O.S): But he is not the child of R¯a’s al
Gh¯ul...
Batman flinches, frozen as Miranda leans into his ear...
147.
MIRANDA: I am.
Miranda has a knife through Batman’s suit, into his ribs...
And though I am not ’ordinary’, I
am a citizen...
She pulls out the trigger...

EXT. FIFTH STREET - CONTINUOUS

Gordon spots the second black truck moving down the street.
His men pull in front, slowing it. Gordon jumps into the
back. The truck accelerates - Gordon drops, hanging on to
the bumper, struggling with the box, trying to turn it on...

INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Batman cannot move to defend himself. He has Bane by the
throat, but Miranda has her knife in his side -
MIRANDA/TALIA: My mother named me Talia before she
was killed. The way I would’ve been
killed if not for my
protector...Bane.
INSERT CUT: the child, Talia, makes eye-contact with the
Protector, then leaps. Down below, Prisoners swarm over the
protector, ripping the muslin from his face. Bane looks up
at Talia, says one quiet word -
BANE: Goodbye.
Then is overrun.
TALIA: I climbed out of the pit...
INSERT CUT: Young Talia stands by the hole looking out at
the landscape...
I found my father and brought him
back to exact terrible vengeance -
but by that time...the prisoners
and the doctor had done their work
to my friend...my protector...
Talia reaches up to touch Bane’s mask.
148.
INSERT CUT: the League of Shadows descend into the prison -
at their head, R¯a’s al Gh¯ul. They slaughter prisoners. Then
stop. R¯a’s al Gh¯ul has found Bane, bandaged.
TALIA: The League took us in. Trained
us...

INT. TEMPLE, LEAGUE OF SHADOWS - DAY

Bane in a prototype mask, stands on logs, blocking blows
from men with sticks.
TALIA (V.O.): But my father could not accept
Bane.
R¯a’s al Gh¯ul watches Bane training. Turns away.

INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Talia looks into Bane’s eyes as she holds the knife in
Batman’s side.
TALIA: He saw only a monster who could
never be tamed. Whose very
existence was a reminder of the
hell he’d left his wife to die in.
He excommunicated Bane from the
League of Shadows. His only crime
was that he loved me. I could not
truly forgive my father...
Talia looks at Batman, cold.
Until you murdered him.
BATMAN: He was trying to kill millions of
innocent people -
TALIA: ’Innocent’ is a strong word to
throw around Gotham, Bruce. I honor
my father by finishing his work.
Vengeance against the man who
killed him is simply a reward for
my patience...
Talia twists the knife in Batman’s side.
You see, it’s the slow knife...the
knife that takes its time, the
(MORE): 149.
TALIA (cont’d)
knife that waits years without
forgetting, then slips quietly
between bones...that’s the knife -
Talia arms the trigger...
- that cuts deepest.
She hits the button - nothing.

EXT. FIFTH STREET - CONTINUOUS

A light on the metal box is blinking. Gordon hangs on -

INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Talia turns, furious.
BATMAN: Your knife may have been too
slow...
A Mercenary steps forward -
MERCENARY: The truck’s under attack -
Talia looks around, mind racing.
TALIA: Gordon. (To Batman.) You gave him a
way to block my signal. No matter -
(Looks at watch.)
He’s bought
Gotham eleven minutes. (Shouts at
Mercenary.) Prepare a convoy. We
must secure the bomb until it
detonates.
Talia jumps to her feet. Bane grabs a shotgun from a
Mercenary - points it at Batman.
TALIA: Not yet... I want him to heel the
heat. (To Batman.) Feel the fire of
twelve million souls you failed.
Talia reaches up to Bane’s mask, reconnects his tubes,
tenderly.
Goodbye, my friend.
Bane nods at her, slowly. Talia moves out with the
Mercenaries.
150.

EXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Talia gets into a Tumbler with a Mercenary. Three Tumblers
pull out in convoy, blowing anything out of the way - cars,
cops.
Foley stands in the road, firing his sidearm. Talia’s
Tumbler SMASHES him out of the way.

INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Bane grabs Batman, throws him into the floor - checks the
rounds in the barrels.
BANE: You’ll have to imagine the fire -
He shuts the gun - jams it into Batman’s face.
We both know I need to kill you
now.
He squeezes the trigger. BLAMMM! Bane is blasted across the
lobby by cannon fire.
Catwoman is there, on the Bat-Pod.
CATWOMAN: The whole no-guns thing? I don’t
feel as strongly about it as you
do.

EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Blake pulls up to the barricade, leads the kids off,
marching them up the bridge, Father Reilly at the rear. A
Uniform shouts through the loudhailer -
UNIFORM: Stay there! What are you doing?!
BLAKE: (pulls badge)
Blake, MCU - I’m getting these boys
to safety -
UNIFORM: Safety?! You’re gonna get us all
killed. Anyone crosses this bridge
they blow the city -
151.
BLAKE: It’s gonna blow anyway. We need
this bridge open right now.
UNIFORM: No one leaves the island. Orders -
BLAKE: Whose orders? Bane’s?
UNIFORM: Police Department’s.
BLAKE: Haven’t you heard the shooting? The
Batman’s battling it out with Bane
-
UNIFORM: The Batman’s dead. Look, Officer -
BLAKE: It’s Detective -
UNIFORM: Well, Detective, you take one more
step, we have to shoot you. Two
more steps, we have to blow the
bridge.
BLAKE: (to the boys)
Wait for me back at the bus.
The Boys walk back down the bridge...

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Talia’s convoy surrounds the black truck. Tumblers off each
flank, protecting the bomb as it counts down...

INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Batman looks at Catwoman.
BATMAN: I need you on the ground, me in the
air, we have to force that convoy
east, to the entrance to the
reactor -
152.

EXT. CITY HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Catwoman roars down the steps on the Bat-Pod.

INT. BLACK TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Gordon climbs into the back of the truck - the bomb is
there, heating up. He looks at the countdown - nine
minutes...

EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Blake turns back to the Uniform.
BLAKE: Your orders are out of date! The
situation’s changed! Listen, I’m a
cop like you. And I’m walking out
there. Please don’t shoot me.
Blake walks. Shots ring out at his feet. He keeps walking...

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The Bat descends on the convoy, Catwoman approaches on the
ground. A rolling battle ensues. Catwoman targets the rear
of the Tumblers, Batman swings the Bat in low at the
junctions, trying to force the convoy east...
The Tumbler’s gun turrets swing around onto Catwoman. She
swerves to avoid heave fire.

EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Blake continues to walk, ignoring the warning shots.
UNIFORM: Son-of-a-bitch! (To his partner.)
Blow it! Before he reaches the line
-
His partner arms the detonator. Uniform shouts at Blake -
UNIFORM: Get down! We’re blowing the bridge!
As Blake looks, disbelieving, the bridge in front of him
blasts upwards in a massive fireball. Blake dives backwards.
153.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The Bat blasts away in front of the convoy, making a huge
crater in front of a Tumbler and trapping it, rear in the
air. Catwoman dodges around it, uses the Bat-Pod cannons to
take out another Tumbler... The countdown ticks away...seven
minutes.

INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS

As Fox fires up the reactor something catches his eye -
something is wrong...

EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

The smoke clears, Blake sees the impossible gap.
BLAKE: You idiots! You sons of bitches!
You’re killing us!!

INT. BLACK TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Gordon climbs out the back of the truck but is immediately
strafed by gunfire from the Tumblers. He dives back inside,
moves to the front of the trailer - looks at the bulkhead,
gauging the driver’s position. Starts firing blind through
the bulkhead -

INT. CAB, BLACK TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Bullets fly through the cab. The driver takes one, falls
forward, dead. Talia takes the wheel - bullets keep coming.

EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Blake races back. Father Reilly has the boys in a huddle,
praying -
BLAKE: Father! Get the boys on the bus -
FATHER REILLY: But there’s nowhere to go, son.
154.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The Bat spins down in front of the black truck, forcing it
into a hard right turn...

INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Talia watches the navigation screen.
TUMBLER DRIVER: (over radio)
They’re trying to force us onto
Grand -
TALIA: Pushing us to the entrance of the
reactor. They’re going to try and
reconnect the core.
TUMBLER DRIVER: (over radio)
Can they?
Talia smiles.

INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS

Fox runs to a ladder. Alarms sound. As he hits the ladder he
turns. A massive rumble builds - water SMASHES into the
reactor, flooding in from both directions.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Catwoman comes up behind the lead Tumbler. She blasts it
again and again - it flips diagonally into the path of the
black truck, causing the truck to lurch onto its side. Both
vehicles careen into the mouth of the tunnel.

INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS

Fox loops his arm around a rung of the ladder and braces as
a wave smashes into him, painfully...
155.

EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Gordon jumps out of the truck, opening the rear doors to
expose the glowing core. Catwoman pulls up on the Bat-Pod.
GORDON: Give me a hand!
The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try
and grab the core but it is too hot.
Let’s get a cable on it and drag it
out! Come on, we’re almost there -
Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck.
Dying.
TALIA: Fox showed me how to operate the
reactor core. Including the
emergency flood -

INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS

Fox pulls himself above the rising whitewater -

EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Gordon looks down at Talia. Batman is at his side.
TALIA: There is no way to stop this bomb.
Prepare yourselves... (Looks up at
Batman.) My father’s work is done.
Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns -
Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to
attach a hoist from the Bat.
GORDON: What’re you doing?
BATMAN: Two minutes. I can fly it out over
the bay...
Catwoman is at his side as he works.
CATWOMAN: Rig it out to fly over the water,
then bail -
156.
BATMAN: No autopilot.
She takes this in. He stands to face her.
CATWOMAN: You could’ve gone anywhere. Been
anything. But you came back here.
BATMAN: So did you.
CATWOMAN: I guess we’re both suckers.
She puts his arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves
to the Bat, Gordon alongside.
GORDON: So this is the part where you
vanish, only this time you don’t
come back?
Batman opens the canopy.

EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Blake grabs at the smallest boys, shoving them onto the bus.
BLAKE: Come on! On the bus!
FATHER REILLY: What’re you doing?
BLAKE: Protection from the blast -
FATHER REILLY: It’s an atom bomb -!
Blake turns on Father Reilly, furious.
BLAKE: You think they need to hear that in
their last seconds? You think I’m
going to let them die without hope?
157.

EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Gordon puts a hand on Batman’s arm.
GORDON: I never cared who you were -
BATMAN: And you were right.
GORDON: But shouldn’t the people know the
hero who saved them?
BATMAN: A hero can be anyone. That was
always the point.
Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon.
Anyone. A man doing something as
simple and reassuring as putting a
coat around a little boy’s
shoulders to let him know that the
world hadn’t ended...
The canopy loses - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers
-
INSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat
around the Young Bruce’s shoulders, his eyes reassuring,
loving.
Gordon looks up to the cockpit -
GORDON: Bruce Wayne?
- but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS
out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the
tunnel mouth.
The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A
building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but
there’s no power to get over it.

EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Blake shouts into the bus -
BLAKE: Heads down! Heads down, now!
158.
FATHER REILLY: Blake, they need to make their
peace.
Blake turns to him, furious.
BLAKE: They’re children! They have no
peace to make -
An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across,
startled, turns to the children on the bus.
Get down! This is it!
The smallest of the boys stares through the window past
Blake.
LITTLE BOY: No. That’s Batman!
Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of
Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves
dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth
of the river...the bay...the ocean...
Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST
- wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly
over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham...
As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its
inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and
boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon.
GORDON (V.O.): ’I see a beautiful city and a
brilliant people rising from this
abyss...’
Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river.
GORDON (V.O.): ’I see the lives for which I lay
down my life, peaceful, useful,
prosperous and happy...’

EXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR - DAY

Gordon is reading from A Tale of Two Cities. Opposite is
Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim. Another figure is
there, whose face we do not yet see...
159.
GORDON: ’I see that I hold a sanctuary in
their hearts, and in the hearts of
their descendants, generations
hence. It is a far, far better
thing that I do, than I have ever
done...’
Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne’s grave.
’It is a far, far better rest that
I go to than I have ever known.’
Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him...
Alfred. Tears streaming.
Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred’s shoulder, then leaves.
Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne
family, turns to the grave beside Bruce’s - the grave of
Thomas and Martha Wayne.
ALFRED: I’m so sorry. I failed you. You
trusted me, and I failed you.
And the old man’s shoulders begin to shake with sobs.

EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

Gordon nods at Lucius. Blake is at Gordon’s side.
GORDON: Can I change your mind about
quitting the force?
BLAKE: No. What you said about structures.
About shackles. I can’t take it.
The injustice. (Gestures at
gardens.) I mean...no one’s ever
going to know who saved an entire
city.
GORDON: They know. (Off look.) It was
Batman.
160.

EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY

Gordon, on a platform with dignitaries, watches a statue
being unveiled. The curtain parts: Batman, immortalized in
granite. We move in on the stone face...
VOICE (V.O.): Mr. Wayne’s will was not amended to
reflect his more modest estate...

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE - DAY

The voice belongs to Wayne’s lawyer, addressing a small
group.
LAWYER: Nonetheless, there are considerable
assets to dispose of... The
contents of the house are to be
sold -
He glances up to see someone slip into the room - Blake.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

Movers carefully bring artworks and furniture out of the
house, watched by a solitary figure. Alfred.
LAWYER (V.O.): - to settle the estate’s accounts.
The remainder is left in its
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth...

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE - DAY

Blake shifts. Out of place. The Lawyer continues.
LAWYER: The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham, on condition
that they never be demolished,
altered, or otherwise interfered
with -
161.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

Different movers carry bunk beds into the huge house.
LAWYER (V.O.): And that they shall be used for one
purpose, and one purpose only...
A schoolbus pulls up. Father Reilly shepherds children
towards the house. The children look up at the house,
wide-eyed.
The housing and care of the city’s
at-risk and orphaned children.
A sign reads: THE MARTHA AND THOMAS WAYNE HOME FOR CHILDREN

INT. LAWYER’S OFFICE - DAY

People file out as the Lawyer stands.
LAWYER: My clerk will help anyone with the
smaller correspondences and
instructions...
Blake approaches the Clerk. She smiles.
BLAKE: Blake, John.
CLERK: (checks list)
Nothing here.
Blake realizes, offers her his driving license.
BLAKE: Try my legal name.
The Clerk glances at the license. Checks.
CLERK: Yup, here it is.
She reaches down behind the desk, sorting through various
items, and hands him a sports bag. Blake takes it, curious.
CLERK: You should use your full name. I
like that name... Robin.
162.
Blake smiles, embarrassed. Leaves.
LAWYER: Any word in the missing item?
CLERK: No, not yet.
LAWYER: Well, they’d better leave no stone
unturned... We can’t just put a
string of pearls on the manifest as
’lost’.

INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - DAY

Fox stands in front of the second camouflage rotor. Two
Techs are examining the controls in the cockpit.
TECH 1: Why worry about the stabilization
software? This whole autopilot
system’s obsolete -
FOX: Please, I just need to know what I
could’ve done to fix it.
TECH 2: But Mr. Fox, it’s already been
fixed. (Typed on panel.) Software
patch...six months ago.
FOX: (confused)
Check the user ident on the
patch...
Tech 2 types some more keys. Looks surprised.
TECH 2: Huh. Bruce Wayne.
Fox turns away from the rotor, an idea starting to form...

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Blake sits in his car looking at a GPS device, puzzled.
Beside him, the sports bag, open. In it is a piece of paper

the trees.

164.

EXT. CAFÉ, FLORENCE - DAY

Alfred folds his paper. Pulls out his money, then stops,

Blake lifts his head, FEELING the bats all around him...
Blake RISES, and is SWALLOWED by the darkness of their wings

COCKS his weapon...
BLAM! With EXPLOSIVE FORCE THE BULLET HOLE DISAPPEARS – A
NICK HAS APPEARED IN THE PROTAGONIST’S UNIFORM – he SPINS –
the SWAT is SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST AND DROPS... revealing a
FIGURE, also in a gas mask and tactical gear...
The Figure TURNS – the Protagonist sees, on the Figure’s
pack, a small TALISMAN – a COIN with a hole tied to a zip by
ORANGE AND YELLOW THREAD – the Protagonist turns back to grab
the bomb –
‘TARGET’: That wasn’t one of us.
PROTAGONIST: I’ll take the help.
The Protagonist GRABS the last bomb: ‘0:03’... he looks up to
the boxes, where REAL SWATS EVACUATE THE HIGH OFFICIALS...
THE PROTAGONIST LOBS THE BOMBS UP INTO THE BOXES...

EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN KIEV – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and ‘Target’ emerge – an EXPLOSION above them
-

INT. THEATRE, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS

INNOCENT CIVILIANS STIR under the EXPLOSION IN THE BOXES –

EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN KIEV – CONTINUOUS

The van PULLS UP – rear door open – they JUMP INSIDE –

INT. VAN – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist pulls off his mask. BREATHING. The Passenger
turns – grabs the ‘Target’s face, SOMETHING WRONG... the
Protagonist turns to the Driver – WHO HAS A GUN POINTED AT
HIM ...:
BLACK SCREEN:: SCREAMING. The Protagonist’s screaming. Close on his eyes –
FLICKERING, SWEATING, PLEADING, DEFIANT... and we are –

EXT. RAIL YARDS – DAY

The Protagonist, tied to a chair, in a windswept rail yard.
In front of him, the ‘Target’, also tied to a chair, back to
us. The Driver steps back, SWEATING. BLOODY PLIERS in hand.
6.
DRIVER: (breathless)
A man can be trained to hold out
for about eighteen hours.
The Driver gestures at a CLOCK on a table –
DRIVER (CONT'D): So your colleagues will clear by 7.
The Driver PUSHES the ‘Target’s chair over. The ‘Target’
lands hard on his side on the gravel. Groaning.
DRIVER (CONT'D): He didn’t last eighteen minutes.
The Driver pulls out a KNIFE. Leans in to the Protagonist –
DRIVER (CONT'D): But he didn’t have anything to
hide. You were smuggling a nobody.
The knife moves towards the Protagonist’s throat...
DRIVER (CONT'D): Risky.
...then to his collar – which he CUTS –
DRIVER (CONT'D): Or were you counting on this?
...pulling out a SILVER CAPSULE. The Protagonist stares.
DRIVER (CONT'D): Death, CIA issue.
The Driver TOSSES the pill, WAVES the pliers at the clock –
DRIVER (CONT'D): Spare yourself once they’re clear.
The Protagonist looks at the clock – ‘5:38’. A FREIGHT TRAIN
RUMBLES PAST, CLOSE... As we close in on the clock, THE
PROTAGONIST’S SCREAMS ARE DROWNED OUT BY THE FREIGHT TRAIN...
The Driver steps back. The Protagonist breathes heavy, blood
dribbling... the Driver follows his gaze to the clock –
‘6:53’ – then checks his watch. Frowns theatrically, picks up
the clock, SHAKES it –
DRIVER (CONT'D): Running fast...
The Driver SETS THE HANDS BACK ONE HOUR. The Protagonist
watches, DESPAIRING... as the Driver puts the clock back on
the table, the Protagonist notices the ‘Target’s FINGERS
WIGGLING... in them is a SILVER PILL...
7.
Freight trains rumble past in opposite directions, sound
BUILDING... The Driver approaches, bloody pliers in hand –
PROTAGONIST: We were alone.
DRIVER: I didn’t ask. Which means we’re
finally getting somewhere.
The Protagonist HURLS himself onto the ‘Target’s hands – face
SMASHING – gets the PILL into his mouth – BITES DOWN –
DEAFENING TRAIN NOISE...: Arms GRAB at him – HANDS PRY his jaw as he SEIZES, MOUTH
FOAMING... the Protagonist’s EYES GLAZE and we –
CUT TO:: Black screen.
Supertitle:
TENET:
FADE IN:: The Protagonist opens his eyes. A man stands beside his bed.
SWAYING gently. This is FAY.
FAY: Welcome to the afterlife.
The Protagonist lifts his head and we are –

INT. BOAT AT SEA – DAY

The Protagonist sees the STEELY OCEAN SWELL...
FAY: You’ve been in a medically induced
coma while we got you out of
Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth.
PROTAGONIST: The pills are fake?
FAY: We swapped yours for a sedative.
PROTAGONIST: Why?
FAY: A test.
The Protagonist runs a finger around his mouth. REALIZING.
8.
PROTAGONIST: Test? They pulled my teeth out.
Fay lets that dissipate. The Protagonist closes his eyes.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Did the team get clear?
FAY: No. Private Russians, we think.
PROTAGONIST: Somebody talked.
FAY: Not you. You chose to die instead
of giving up your colleagues.

EXT. DECK OF THE BOAT – LATER

The Protagonist stands in the wind, contemplating the
horizon.
FAY (O.S.): We all believe we’d run into the
burning building, but until we feel
that heat... we can never know. You
do.
PROTAGONIST: I resign.
FAY: You don’t work for us – you’re
dead.
The Protagonist turns to Fay, confused.
FAY (CONT'D): Your duty transcends national
interests. This is about survival.
PROTAGONIST: Whose?
FAY: Everyone’s. There’s a cold war.
Cold as ice. To even know its true
nature is to lose. This is
knowledge divided – all I have for
you is a gesture –
(interlaces his fingers)
– in combination with a word –
‘tenet’. Use it carefully, it’ll
open the right doors, but some of
the wrong ones, too.
9.
PROTAGONIST: That’s all they’ve told you?
FAY: The test you passed?
(beat)
Not everybody does.
Fay breaks eye contact with the Protagonist. The boat
continues to nose into the swell.

EXT. LAUNCH, WIND FARM AT SEA – DUSK

The Protagonist is driven away from the boat on a launch,
towards the GIANT WHITE TURBINES of the ocean wind farm.
The launch SLIPS amongst them, seeking the ladder of a
particular one...
The Protagonist climbs the ladder to a door. He tries it –
it’s open. He turns to see the launch move off into the
gathering dark. The Protagonist ENTERS the wind turbine.

INT. WIND TURBINE – CONTINUOUS

In the bare space, the Protagonist finds a SPORTS BAG, a COT,
a pallet of WATER and PROTEIN BARS. He opens the sports bag
to find passports, cash, credit cards and a HI-VIZ VEST.
Under the vest is a small black cylinder. He unscrews the top
to find three SILVER SUICIDE PILLS. The Protagonist shakes
his head as he tosses them back into the bag.

INT. WIND TURBINE – LATER

The Protagonist EATS, DRINKS and EXERCISES by CLIMBING the
endless interior ladder of the turbine. The stash of food and
water SHRINKS...
The Protagonist does PULL-UPS at the very top of the ladder,
FEET DANGLING over the VERTIGINOUS DROP...

INT. WIND TURBINE – MORNING

The Protagonist is woken by a repeated AIR HORN. He pulls
himself off the cot, opens the door to find –

EXT. WIND TURBINE – CONTINUOUS

A large CATAMARAN nosed up to the windmill, ladder in place,
MAINTENANCE CREW in HI-VIZ VESTS moving on and off the
turbine. Other boats service other turbines. The Protagonist
pulls on his VEST and CLIMBS down onto the catamaran.
10.

EXT. EUROPEAN PORT – DAY

The Protagonist disembarks with the rest of the wind-farm
crew. As they file past a car the driver, also in hi-viz,
steps out into line, leaving the door open, engine running.
The Protagonist gets in. The GPS is already set...

EXT. OFFICE COMPLEX – LATER

A bland suburban office park. The Protagonist gets out of the
car, wearing his hi-viz and carrying a clipboard. Heads
inside, passing numerous STAFF coming out...

INT. LOBBY, OFFICE COMPLEX – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist moves through the lobby unimpeded. Checking
the tenant listings he sees – ‘WINDFARM TRANSITIONS – B-2’.

INT. CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist walks up to B-2.
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.): With a hi-viz vest and a clipboard,
you can get almost anywhere.
Almost.
The Protagonist turns to find a brusque young woman. This is
BARBARA. He joins his hands, interlacing the fingers...
PROTAGONIST: A pretty obscure tenet.
Using a key card, she ushers him through a door into –

INT. OFFICE, LABORATORY – CONTINUOUS

Barbara hands the Protagonist a cup of tea.
BARBARA: No small talk, nothing that might
reveal who we are, or what we do.
PROTAGONIST: I thought I was here to find out
what we do.
BARBARA: You’re not here for ‘what’, you’re
here for ‘how’. ‘What’ is your
department. And not my business.
11.
PROTAGONIST: Well, to do what I do, I need some
idea of the threat we face.
Barbara considers the Protagonist. Sips her tea.
BARBARA: As I understand it, we’re trying to
prevent World War Three.
PROTAGONIST: Nuclear holocaust?
BARBARA: No. Something worse.

INT. SHOOTING RANGE – MOMENTS LATER

Barbara hands the Protagonist a semi-automatic. He
reflexively checks the chamber and magazine – EMPTY.
BARBARA: Aim it and pull the trigger.
The Protagonist SHRUGS, lifts the empty pistol, sights a
target 25m away with several holes in it...
He squeezes the trigger – BAM! – a shot. He is CONFUSED...
BARBARA (CONT'D): Check the magazine.
The Protagonist checks the clip – THERE IS A ROUND IN IT.
PROTAGONIST: How?
Barbara pulls on PROTECTIVE GLOVES and removes the round from
the clip, placing it next to an identical one on a table.
BARBARA: One of these bullets is, like us,
travelling forwards through time.
The other one’s going backwards.
Can you tell which is which?
The Protagonist shakes his head. Barbara reaches forward –
BARBARA (CONT'D): How about now? –
One of the rounds FLIES UP INTO HER HAND, FALLING IN REVERSE.
The Protagonist is taken aback. Barbara holds the round
towards him so he can inspect it –
12.
BARBARA (CONT'D): It’s inverted – its entropy runs
backwards. So, to our eyes, its
movement is reversed. We think it’s
a type of inverse radiation,
triggered by nuclear fission.
PROTAGONIST: You didn’t make it?
BARBARA: We don’t know how. Yet.
PROTAGONIST: So where’d it come from?
BARBARA: Someone’s manufacturing them in the
future. They’re streaming back at
us.
Barbara places the round on the table, in front of a CAMERA.
BARBARA (CONT'D): Try it.
He puts on a glove – moves his hand over it, nothing.
BARBARA (CONT'D): You have to have dropped it.
The Protagonist reaches out again – it LEAPS UP INTO HIS
HAND.:
PROTAGONIST: How can it move before I touch it?
She cues up the recording of what he just did –
BARBARA: From your point of view you caught
it, but from the bullet’s point of
view...
She plays it BACKWARDS –
BARBARA (CONT'D): ...you dropped it.
ON THE SCREEN: the round FALLS from his hand.
PROTAGONIST: But cause has to come before
effect.
BARBARA: No. That’s just how we see time.
13.
She PULLS the round towards herself using one finger – the
round follows her finger as if MAGNETIZED...
PROTAGONIST: What about free will?
BARBARA: That bullet wouldn’t have moved if
you hadn’t put your hand there.
Either way we run the tape, you
made it happen.
She LAUNCHES it up into her other hand –
BARBARA (CONT'D): Don’t try to understand it. Feel
it.
Barbara PLAYS with the round in increasingly IMPROBABLE,
BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENTS... The round SHOOTS AWAY FROM HER – the
Protagonist CATCHES IT...
PROTAGONIST: Instinct. Got it.
Barbara smiles, swaps him the round for the pistol. She then
places a TRAY COVERED IN SHELL CASINGS beside him.
The Protagonist aims at the target – a shell casing LEAPS
into the gun – he FIRES, and a bullet hole near the bullseye
VANISHES –:
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Why does it feel so strange?
BARBARA: You’re not shooting the bullet,
you’re catching it.
PROTAGONIST: Whoa.
The Protagonist examines the target – no bullet holes.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): I’ve seen this type of ammunition
before.
BARBARA: In the field?
PROTAGONIST: I was almost hit.
BARBARA: Then you are exceedingly lucky...
The Protagonist turns to her...
14.
BARBARA (CONT'D): An inverted bullet passing through
your body would be devastating. The
inverse radiation would spread
through your body. Like polonium
poisoning. Not pretty.
The Protagonist examines the rounds...
PROTAGONIST: These look like today’s.
BARBARA: They may have been made today, then
inverted years from now.
PROTAGONIST: Where did you get them?
BARBARA: They came with the wall. I was
assigned it, like all the material
I’m studying here.
PROTAGONIST: Do you have an analysis of the
metals?
BARBARA: Sure. Why?
PROTAGONIST: The mixture of alloys can tell me
where they might have been made.
Look, I know you said that ‘what’
is my business –
BARBARA: Let’s not go off-topic.
PROTAGONIST: I’m not seeing Armageddon here.
Barbara takes the round from him, and beckons him to follow –

INT. ARCHIVE – CONTINUOUS

Between tall sets of DRAWERS...
BARBARA: A bullet may not seem like much,
but it’s a simple machine – lead
bullet, brass casing, gunpowder. If
they can invert this – I see no
reason they couldn’t invert pretty
much anything. Even a nuclear
weapon can only affect our future.
(MORE): 15.
An inverted weapon might be able to
affect our past as well.
Barbara stops at a drawer. Gestures around herself –
BARBARA (CONT'D): Now that we know what to look for,
we’re finding more and more
inverted material...
She opens a drawer, revealing a VARIETY OF RUSTED BITS AND
PIECES – SCREWS, CRACKED LENSES, METAL RODS, BUTTONS...
BARBARA (CONT'D): ...remnants of complex objects.
The Protagonist reaches out and lets a RUSTED BUCKLE leap
into his hand.
PROTAGONIST: So what do you think we’re seeing?
BARBARA: The detritus of a coming war.
The Protagonist looks around at the MULTITUDE of DRAWERS.

EXT. CROWDED STREET, MUMBAI – DAY

The Protagonist walks out of an electronics store, opening a
new phone, and slips into the throng. He dials –
MALE VOICE: (over phone)
Yup?
PROTAGONIST: We live in a twilight world.
MALE VOICE: (over phone)
No friends at dusk. I was told
you’d left the building.
PROTAGONIST: Even the dead need allies.
MALE VOICE: (over phone)
Specifically?
PROTAGONIST: An assist in Mumbai. To get to
Sanjay Singh.
BARBARA (CONT'D): 16.
MALE VOICE: (over phone)
Singh? He never leaves his house,
and his house... well, it’s –
PROTAGONIST: Yes, it is – I’m looking right at
it.
Above the bustling street, a HIGH-RISE HOUSE, at least twenty
storeys tall, with two large balconies, towers over...
MALE VOICE: (over phone)
I’ll see who’s on deck. Bombay
Yacht Club, two hours.
As the Protagonist hangs up, he spots a figure, on the top
balcony. A WOMAN IN A SARI, standing high above the city.

INT. BOMBAY YACHT CLUB – EVENING

The Protagonist enters the quiet ex-colonial establishment.
Takes a seat. A BUSINESSMAN sits down next to him.
BUSINESSMAN: It seems you need an introduction
to a prominent Mumbai local on
short notice. I’m Neil.
Neil offers his hand. The Protagonist takes it –
PROTAGONIST: I need an audience with Sanjay
Singh.
NEIL: Not possible.
PROTAGONIST: Ten minutes, tops.
NEIL: Time isn’t the problem. Getting out
alive’s the problem.
(thinks)
Would you take a child hostage?
The Protagonist shakes his head.
NEIL (CONT'D): A woman?
PROTAGONIST: If I had to. I’m not looking to
make much noise here.
17.
Neil keeps thinking. Signals a waiter –
NEIL: Vodka tonic.
(gestures at the
Protagonist)
Diet Coke.
The Protagonist stares at Neil. Neil looks up, confused.
NEIL (CONT'D): What? You never drink on the job.
PROTAGONIST: You’re well informed.
NEIL: It pays to be in our profession.
PROTAGONIST: Well, I prefer club soda.
NEIL: (grins)
No, you don’t.
Neil raps his knuckles on the table, thinking.
NEIL (CONT'D): How’s your parachuting?
PROTAGONIST: Broke an ankle in basic training.
Singh’s house isn’t tall enough to
parachute off of.
NEIL: (thinks)
But it’s bungee-jumpable.
PROTAGONIST: I don’t think ‘bungee-jumpable’ is
a word.
NEIL: It may not be a word, but it may be
your only way out of that place.
(a thought occurs)
Or into it, for that matter.

EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – EVENING

ARMED GUARDS patrol the balconies.
18.

INT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

Inside one of the magnificent rooms, a middle-aged Indian man
mixes drinks. This is SANJAY SINGH.

EXT. LOW ROOFTOP NEXT DOOR TO HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

Neil and the Protagonist race across the roof carrying a
sports bag. Neil pulls out a WINCH, the Protagonist pulls out
a large CATAPULT, loops it around two pipes, glancing down
into the WALLED YARD at the foot of the high-rise house.
Neil BOLTS the winch to the roof, the Protagonist sights the
upper balcony of the high-rise house, FIRES a ball with a
line up and over the balcony railing...

EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and Neil lie next to each other as the WINCH
RUNS, TENSIONING THEIR ELASTIC LINES... they LAUNCH
themselves, FLYING UP to land against the side of the
building –
They RUN SILENTLY UP THE BUILDING, onto the UPPER TERRACES,
SHOOTING TWO GUARDS with silenced pistols...

INT./EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

Sanjay Singh hands a drink to the Woman in the sari. They
move out onto the balcony –

EXT. BALCONY – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist surprises Sanjay, holds him at gunpoint –
PROTAGONIST: (to the Woman)
Stay back.
(to Sanjay)
I was almost taken out by a very
unusual type of ammunition in
Ukraine. I want to know who
supplied it.
SANJAY: My name’s Sanjay. And you are?
(silence)
No chit-chat?
The Woman pushes a RED BUTTON on the wall –
19.
PROTAGONIST: There’s no one at the other end. No
one who’s going to help you,
anyway.

INT. SECURITY STATION, HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

An alarm buzzes, the Security Guards are frozen, Neil has a
gun on them, a finger to his lips...

EXT. BALCONY, HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS

Sanjay tries to turn to see the Protagonist –
SANJAY: Why would I know who supplied it?
The Protagonist pushes his head back around with the gun –
PROTAGONIST: The combination of metals is unique
to India. If it’s from India, it’s
from you.
SANJAY: A fair assumption –
PROTAGONIST: Deduction.
SANJAY: Deduction, then. Look, my friend,
guns are never conducive to a
productive negotiation.
PROTAGONIST: I’m not the man they send to
negotiate...
He COCKS his weapon – puts the gun to Sanjay’s head –
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): But I am the man people talk to.
SANJAY: (charm curdles)
I can’t. I can’t tell you.
PROTAGONIST: You’re an arms dealer, friend –
this may be the easiest trigger
I’ve ever had to pull.
20.
WOMAN (O.S.): To say anything about a client
would violate the tenets he lives
by...
The Protagonist GLANCES at the Woman... whose fingers are
casually INTERTWINED. The Protagonist brings his free hand up
to hold the gun in both hands, fingers INTERLACED...
PROTAGONIST: If tenets are important to you,
then you can tell me. Everything.
WOMAN: Not while you have a gun to my
husband’s head.
The Protagonist releases him.
WOMAN (CONT'D): Sanjay, make us a drink.

INT. TERRACE OVERLOOKING MUMBAI, SANJAY’S HOUSE – LATER

Overlooking the extraordinary bustle of the city. Sanjay has
left. His wife hands the Protagonist his drink –
PRIYA: I’m Priya Singh.
PROTAGONIST: This is your operation?
PRIYA: A masculine front in a man’s world
has its uses. The dealer you’re
looking for is Andrei Sator.
PROTAGONIST: The Russian oligarch?
PRIYA: You know him?
PROTAGONIST: Not personally. Made his billions
in gas, moved to London and married
an English girl. Said to be on the
outs with Moscow.
PRIYA: Very good. Except the ‘gas’ he made
his billions from was actually
plutonium, and he’s said to be on
the outs so he can feed British
Intelligence whatever the Russians
want them to think they know.
21.
PROTAGONIST: None of which explains how or why
you sold him inverted munitions.
PRIYA: When I sold him the rounds, they
were perfectly ordinary.
PROTAGONIST: So how did he get them inverted?
PRIYA: We believe he’s functioning as some
kind of broker between our time and
the future.
PROTAGONIST: He can communicate with the future?
PRIYA: We all do. Credit cards, email,
text – anything that goes into the
record speaks directly to the
future. The question is – can the
future speak back? And, if so, what
are they saying?
PROTAGONIST: And I’m supposed to find out?
PRIYA: To get anywhere near Sator would
take a fresh-faced protagonist...
She reaches up to touch his cheek.
PRIYA (CONT'D): Fresh as a daisy. Get close, find
out what he’s receiving and how.
PROTAGONIST: Is it safe to involve British
Intelligence?
PRIYA: I have a contact who’s out of
Sator’s reach.
PROTAGONIST: One of us?
PRIYA: No, he thinks we’re chasing
plutonium.
SIRENS. BANGS! Priya looks over to see POLICE CARS arriving
far below, in the WALLED YARD at the foot of her house...
22.
PRIYA (CONT'D): You’d better get out of here.
PROTAGONIST: Can’t you explain things?
PRIYA: You have to start looking at the
world in a new way – this conflict
runs backwards and forwards
simultaneously. Your name on a
police report reveals your identity
to the future – they pass it back
to Sator –
PROTAGONIST: My cover’s blown before I get near
him.
PRIYA: You got in – you must’ve had a plan
for getting out.
The Protagonist pulls a CLIP and cord from his harness –
PROTAGONIST: Not one I loved.
Priya watches him clip onto the balcony rail. Neil FLIES
PAST, dropping from the balcony above.
The Protagonist JUMPS, SLOWING as he DROPS BEHIND THE WALL,
OUT OF REACH OF THE POLICE, into a MARKET STREET and RELEASES
his harness – disappearing into the crowd...

EXT. MEMBER’S CLUB, LONDON – DAY

The Protagonist walks down the busy Mall, and up the steps...

INT. MEMBER’S CLUB, LONDON – DAY

The Protagonist enters, is approached by a STEWARD.
STEWARD: Can I help you, sir?
PROTAGONIST: I’m Mr Crosby’s lunch.
STEWARD: I presume you mean Sir Michael
Crosby’s lunch?
PROTAGONIST: Presume away.
23.
STEWARD: If you’ll follow me.

INT. LOUNGE, MEMBER’S CLUB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is shown to a table where a distinguished
middle-aged man is already eating. CROSBY.
CROSBY: Started without you, hope you don’t
mind.
PROTAGONIST: I’ll catch up.
(to the Steward)
Same for me.
STEWARD: I’ll send the waiter.
PROTAGONIST: No, just pass on the order.
Crosby smiles at the Protagonist’s handling of the Steward.
CROSBY: I gather you’ve an interest in a
certain Russian national.
PROTAGONIST: Anglo-Russian. So I’ll have to
watch my step.
CROSBY: Indeed. He’s tapped into the
intelligence services – I’ve warned
them he’s feeding them rubbish, but
they don’t seem to care.
PROTAGONIST: Tell me about him.
CROSBY: I assume you’re familiar with the
Soviet-era secret cities?
PROTAGONIST: Closed cities, not shown on maps,
built up around sensitive
industries. Most of them have been
opened up and renamed as regular
towns.
CROSBY: Not the one Sator grew up in.
Stalsk-12.
(MORE): 24.
In the seventies our people
estimated its population at almost
200,000. Unacknowledged to this
day. Thought to be abandoned.
PROTAGONIST: Abandoned?
CROSBY: Some kind of accident. After which
we think it became a site for
underground tests. Just two weeks
ago, same day as the Kiev Opera
siege, our satellites detected a
detonation in north-west Siberia,
about where we think Stalsk-12 was.
PROTAGONIST: Nuclear?
CROSBY: Big enough to be noticed. Sator
emerged from this blank spot on the
map with an ambition that
eventually led him here, to buy his
way into the British establishment.
PROTAGONIST: Through his wife?
CROSBY: Katherine Barton, eldest niece of
Sir Frederick Barton. She works at
Shipley’s, met Sator at an auction.
PROTAGONIST: He’s into art?
CROSBY: Like a lot of wealthy criminals, he
thinks if he covers his walls with
tasteful, expensive things it’ll
distract from the bloodshed.
Judging by the lovely girl he
married, there might be something
in it.
PROTAGONIST: Happy marriage?
CROSBY: No. Practically estranged.
PROTAGONIST: How do I get to Sator?
CROSBY: Through her, of course.
CROSBY (CONT'D): 25.
PROTAGONIST: You may have an inflated idea of my
powers of seduction.
CROSBY: Hardly. We have an ace in the
hole...
Crosby slides a SHOPPING BAG over to the Protagonist’s feet.
The Protagonist looks inside: a small FRAMED DRAWING.
PROTAGONIST: You’re carrying a Goya in a Harrods
bag?
CROSBY: It’s a fake, by a Spaniard named
Arepo. One of two we confiscated
from an embezzler in Bern. We hung
on to this one for a rainy day – I
felt the first drops when India
called.
PROTAGONIST: What happened to the other one?
CROSBY: A Rubens. It turned up at
Shipley’s, where it was
authenticated by Katherine Barton
before going under the hammer. And
who do you suppose bought it?
PROTAGONIST: Her husband? Does she know it’s a
forgery?
CROSBY: Hard to say. Rumour had it that she
and Arepo were close.
Crosby looks the Protagonist over –
CROSBY (CONT'D): Look, no offence, but this is a
world where someone claiming to be
a billionaire gets asked if they’re
just a dollar billionaire.
PROTAGONIST: And?
CROSBY: Brooks Brothers won’t cut it.
PROTAGONIST: I’m assuming I have a budget.
26.
CROSBY: (tosses him a credit
card)
Save the world, then we’ll balance
the books. Can I recommend a
tailor?
PROTAGONIST: I’ll manage. You British don’t have
a monopoly on snobbery, you know.
CROSBY: Not a monopoly. More of a
controlling interest.
The Protagonist rises, taking the credit card and the bag.
PROTAGONIST: Thanks for this. By the way, is she
a Kate or a Kathy?
CROSBY: A Kat, I believe.
The waiter arrives, bearing food, supervised by the Steward.
PROTAGONIST: Could you box that for me?
STEWARD: Certainly not.
The Protagonist smiles at Crosby, who nods goodbye.
PROTAGONIST: Goodbye, Sir Michael.

EXT. WEST LONDON PRIVATE SCHOOL – DAY

Mothers stand at the railings waiting for their kids. One of
them, a smart YOUNG WOMAN, stands a little apart from the
group. SCHOOLKIDS pile out of the school...

INT./EXT. CAR – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist watches from across the road as the Young
Woman SPOTS her son. She offers him her hand, but he reaches
up to take his NANNY’S. She moves her hand to pick something
off his jumper before he is put into the back of a BLACK
RANGE ROVER with tinted windows.
The Protagonist watches the Young Woman wave at the departing
car carrying her child. Utterly alone.
27.

EXT. SHIPLEY’S, LONDON – DAY

A BENTLEY pulls up – a DOORMAN opens the rear door, the
Protagonist emerges, IMMACULATELY TAILORED, holding a
beautiful leather briefcase.

INT. SHIPLEY’S – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is approached by a REPRESENTATIVE –
REPRESENTATIVE: How can I help, sir?
PROTAGONIST: I have an appraisal with Ms Barton.
REPRESENTATIVE: (to receptionist)
Tell Kat her client is in the
Fallow Room.

INT. APPRAISAL ROOM – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist admires the paintings on the walls. The door
opens and the Young Woman from the school gates comes in,
dressed for business. This is KAT BARTON. She looks bemused,
but gives him a genuine and friendly smile –
KAT: I’m sorry, I wasn’t notified of any
appointments, Mr...
PROTAGONIST: Goya?
KAT: Mr Goya?
The Protagonist opens his briefcase...
PROTAGONIST: No, I’m told you’re the person to
see about...
Offers the drawing to her...
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): ...Goya.
She takes it, suddenly interested...
KAT: Wow. It’s extraordinary.
She lays the drawing on the table and grabs a loupe –
28.
PROTAGONIST: What’s it worth?
KAT: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
There’s a lot of work before any
kind of valuation – provenance,
microscopic examination, X-rays...
She is bent over the table, peering through the loupe.
The Protagonist studies her reaction as he –
PROTAGONIST: But what does your heart tell you?
She steps back. Something about the drawing BOTHERS her...
KAT: I’m sorry, where did you say you
acquired this drawing?
PROTAGONIST: Tomas Arepo.
Kat rises and turns to face the Protagonist. Cold.
KAT: What do you want?
PROTAGONIST: What I want is complicated.
KAT: Do you work for my husband?
PROTAGONIST: I’ve never met your husband. That’s
the reason I’m here. Is there
somewhere we can talk?
KAT: In London? Not really.

INT. RESTAURANT – NIGHT

The Protagonist and Kat sit at a corner table.
PROTAGONIST: I bought my Goya for cents on the
dollar from an irate Swiss banker.
Traced it to Arepo, and realized
I’d scored a bargain when he told
me who’d paid top dollar for
another one of his pictures. Your
husband.
29.
KAT: Where’s the bargain? Your drawing’s
an obvious fake.
PROTAGONIST: My drawing’s a very good fake – you
know that better than anyone. The
information’s the bargain.
KAT: The information that I helped
defraud my own husband?
PROTAGONIST: He and I are in related businesses,
but he’s a hard man to meet. If you
and I were to make an arrangement –
KAT: Arrangement? You mean blackmail.
Don’t be afraid of the word – my
husband isn’t. And I’m sorry to
tell you he got there first.
PROTAGONIST: He knows? And he’s never done
anything about it?
KAT: Why would he?
PROTAGONIST: He paid nine million dollars –
KAT: Which would barely cover the
holiday he just forced us on.
PROTAGONIST: Where’d you go – Mars?
KAT: Viet Nam. On our yacht. His yacht.
Kat looks the Protagonist up and down...
KAT (CONT'D): You’ve got the suit. The shoes, the
watch. But I think you’re a little
out of your depth.
PROTAGONIST: (sharp)
People who’ve amassed fortunes like
your husband’s aren’t generally
okay with being cheated out of any
of it.
30.
Kat sips her wine. Wanting to talk. Knowing she shouldn’t.
KAT: The drawing is his hold over me. He
threatened me with the police,
prison, the works. He controls me,
my contact with my son, everything.
Leaving him would never have been
easy, now it’s impossible. My life,
now... You can’t fight. Just beg.
Or worse. In Viet Nam I tried to
love him again. If there were still
love, he might give me my son. We
sat on that bloody boat and watched
the sunsets, imitating an earlier
time. He seemed happy, so I asked.
And he made me an offer. To let me
go if I agreed to never see my son
again. I expressed myself –
INSERT CUT: a CRYSTAL BOWL of RASPBERRIES SMASHES onto the
polished wood of a yacht’s deck –
KAT (CONT'D): Then took Max ashore. He called us,
contrite. But when we came back...
INSERT CUT: Kat and Max on a launch – Kat follows Max’s gaze
to see a FEMALE FIGURE SLIDE into the water...
KAT (CONT'D): I glimpsed some other woman diving
off the boat. And he’d vanished.
I’ve never felt such envy.
PROTAGONIST: You don’t seem the jealous type.
KAT: Of her. You know how I dream of
just diving off that boat? Of
freedom?
PROTAGONIST: But you share a son.
KAT: And that’s my life.
PROTAGONIST: Did you know the drawing was a
fake?
KAT: The authentication took months –
Arepo and I became close, maybe too
close. Maybe my judgement was
clouded. I failed.
(MORE): 31.
But Andrei can’t conceive of
failure, only betrayal. I didn’t
betray my husband. In retrospect,
maybe I missed my chance.
PROTAGONIST: And he let Arepo walk free?
KAT: If you’d actually met Arepo, as you
claimed, you’d understand that he
no longer walks anywhere.
PROTAGONIST: We spoke on the phone –
KAT: He can’t do that, either.
The Protagonist considers this.
PROTAGONIST: Where’s the drawing?
KAT: Why?
PROTAGONIST: Get me the introduction, I’ll take
the drawing out of the equation. No
picture, no prosecution. No hold
over you.
Kat looks at the Protagonist. Not daring to hope.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): I might just be your second chance
–
KAT: (snaps)
I don’t need redemption.
PROTAGONIST: At betrayal.
A LARGE, WELL-DRESSED THUG sits down at the table. He takes a
green bean from the Protagonist’s plate and chews it
vacantly. This is VOLKOV. The Protagonist looks at Kat –
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Friend of your husband?
(she nods)
You knew this would happen?
KAT (CONT'D): 32.
KAT: They won’t kill you. Andrei
dislikes tangling with local law
enforcement on that level.
PROTAGONIST: You must really not have liked the
look of me.
KAT: (rising)
The look of you is fine. It’s
better to get to the nasty part
before I care one way or the other.
He takes her hand, pulls her forward to kiss her cheek.
PROTAGONIST: (whispers)
There’s a number in your left coat
pocket. Don’t call from home.
A Thug puts a MEATY HAND on the Protagonist’s shoulder.
KAT: You won’t be taking my call.
PROTAGONIST: I might surprise you.
She leaves, BREEZING out through the kitchen... at Volkov’s
nod, two Thugs escort the Protagonist from his chair, heading
towards the kitchen – a WAITER moves to object – Volkov,
eating the Protagonist’s leftovers, pulls the Waiter up
short, shaking his head.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – MOMENTS LATER

Kat exits the restaurant, DISTRAUGHT, walking past a waiting
THUG, then sliding into the back seat of a MERCEDES.

INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS

The driver is a GAUNT RUSSIAN.
KAT: Please, let’s go.
The Gaunt Russian does not react, but watches through the
rear-view mirror as a THUG enters the kitchen –
KAT (CONT'D): Can we get going?
33.

INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist enters the kitchen, followed by the two
thugs. CHEFS and BUSBOYS retreat as the other thug
approaches...

INT./EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS

Kat turns from the window –
KAT: Please!
GAUNT RUSSIAN: He wants you to see...

INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist JACKKNIFES HIS LOWER LEG UP into the crotch
of the thug behind him – SPINS him into the Thug next to him
– POTS and Pans flying –

INT. RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS

Volkov wipes sauce with bread, enjoying noises from the
kitchen...

INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS

The Third Thug SWINGS – the Protagonist DODGES, takes the
blow on the shoulder – SLAMS his head into the Third Thug’s
neck, leaving him GASPING – the Protagonist GRABS the Third
Thug, RACING for the WINDOW...

INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS

Kat FLINCHES as, with a CRASH of plates, a body TUMBLES down
the stairs...
GAUNT RUSSIAN: And he gets what he wants.
Then she sees something else... the Protagonist exits.
KAT: Not always, apparently.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist brushes himself clean, SPOTS the Mercedes,
starts moving towards it –
34.

INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS

The Gaunt Russian SCRAMBLES to get the car moving. Kat looks
back at the Protagonist as the car ROARS away...

EXT. SCHOOL GATES – DAY

Kat is crouched, talking to her son, MAX. The Nanny hovers –
MAX: Anna says we’re going to Pompeii
and see lava.
KAT: We’ll go together. I’ll be there,
too.
Max looks up at the Nanny. Kat hugs him, tight. The Nanny
TAPS Kat on the shoulder. Kat smiles at her son, tears in her
eyes, as the car pulls away. She pulls out her phone,
dials... hears a RINGTONE behind her –
The Protagonist is there.
PROTAGONIST: I said I’d surprise you. He’s a
cute kid.
KAT: Max. He’s everything.
PROTAGONIST: Where’s the drawing?
KAT: Oslo. At the airport.
PROTAGONIST: The airport?
INSERT CUT: a Rotas car drives across an airport apron, and
down a ramp...
KAT: Do you know what a freeport is?
PROTAGONIST: A storage facility for art that’s
been acquired –
...into a SLEEK facility – the OSLO FREEPORT – as a STAFF
MEMBER stands ready to greet a new CLIENT...
35.
KAT (V.O.): But not yet taxed. We started a
network – Rotas, his construction
company, built them, I brought in
clients. The facilities are tax
havens...
The client is NEIL... he takes in the security
arrangements...
PROTAGONIST (V.O.): The clients can view their
investments –

EXT. OSLO OPERA HOUSE – DAY

The Protagonist is standing on the roof of the Oslo Opera
House, briefing Neil...
PROTAGONIST (V.O.): – without importing them, so they
avoid paying tax.
NEIL: Sort of a transit lounge for art?
We go back to Kat, on the street, briefing the Protagonist...
KAT: Art, antiques, anything of value,
really.
PROTAGONIST: Anything?
KAT: Anything legal...
Then back to the Protagonist briefing Neil...
PROTAGONIST: But it’s not unlike the Swiss
banking system. Opaque.
Back to Kat –
KAT: Rotas has assets in the Oslo
Freeport. I’m guessing it’s there.
PROTAGONIST: Guessing?
Back to Oslo –
NEIL: Guessing?
36.
Back to Kat –
KAT: We make trips there four or five
times a year.
PROTAGONIST: To view art?
KAT: And whatever he does – it turns out
art is of no importance to Andrei.
PROTAGONIST: But the freeports are.
Kat nods.

INT. FREEPORT – DAY

A STAFF MEMBER brings Neil into a LUXURIOUS GALLERY –
STAFF MEMBER: Some freeports are just warehouses
– here, you can actually enjoy your
possessions...
Then through doors into an ANGLED INNER CORRIDOR...
STAFF MEMBER (CONT'D): The structure of the vaults is
based on The Pentagon – each vault
a separate structure within the
others. Damage to one structure
won’t compromise the others.
They arrive at a door in the corridor. The Staff Member uses
his thumb to unlock a door –
STAFF MEMBER (CONT'D): Clients have biometric access
straight in off the tarmac.
NEIL: From the terminal?
STAFF MEMBER: (confused)
From their private planes.
NEIL: Of course.
Neil checks the locks as the Staff Member opens the door into
–
37.

INT. FREEPORT SHIPPING AREA – CONTINUOUS

A VAST SHIPPING AREA filled with SHIPPING CONTAINERS –
STAFF MEMBER: Our logistics department ships to
and from other freeports without
customs inspection...
Neil notices ROTAS containers marked for delivery to TALLINN.
NEIL (V.O.): What’re you hoping to find?

EXT. OSLO OPERA HOUSE – DAY

PROTAGONIST: You really want to know?
NEIL: I’m not sure.
PROTAGONIST: Bring some lead-lined gloves.
NEIL: Jesus. Nuclear?
PROTAGONIST: When you’re on the tour –

INT. FREEPORT – DAY

Neil is shown back into one of the vaults...
PROTAGONIST (V.O.): Pay attention to the fire
precautions.
NEIL: Documents are vulnerable to –
STAFF MEMBER: Fire. Absolutely –
NEIL: I was going to say, water damage
from sprinkler systems.
STAFF MEMBER: We don’t use sprinklers.
(points to vents)
The facility is flooded with halide
gas, displacing all the air within
seconds.
38.
NEIL: Can you show me?
STAFF MEMBER: If I did, we’d suffocate.
NEIL: What about the staff in here?
STAFF MEMBER: Halide only fills the vaults – they
just have to get into the corridor.
There’s a ten-second warning.
NEIL: You only give them ten seconds?
STAFF MEMBER: Our clients use us because we have
no priorities above their property.
NEIL: Blimey.
STAFF MEMBER: Well, sir, you asked.

INT. OSLO AIRPORT – DAY

The Protagonist and Neil walk through the terminal.
NEIL: Vault doors are fireproof,
hydraulic closers, simple key and
electronic triggers. Surprisingly
easy, once there’s a lockdown.
PROTAGONIST: Why a lockdown?
NEIL: Power switches to fail-safe,
sealing outer doors, but inner
doors revert to factory settings
and pickable locks. Child’s play,
really.
PROTAGONIST: Child’s play? They’re inside
airport security. They have to
worry about climate control, not
armed raids.
NEIL: So how do we get fire power through
the perimeter to trigger a
lockdown?
39.

EXT. CROWDED AIRPORT BUS, OSLO AIRPORT – DAY

The Protagonist and Neil look across the tarmac to the
freeport structure.
NEIL: Back wall of the freeport...
The Protagonist notices Neil start to smile...
PROTAGONIST: You’ve got something?
NEIL: You’re not going to like it.

EXT. OSLO STREET – DAY

The Protagonist looks at Neil in disbelief.
PROTAGONIST: You want to crash a plane?
NEIL: Not from the air, don’t be so
dramatic. I want to run a jet off
the taxiway, breach the rear wall,
start a fire.
PROTAGONIST: How big a plane?
NEIL: Well, that part is a little
dramatic.
They approach a MAN sitting on a harbour-front bench.
NEIL (CONT'D): This is Mahir. His team will work
the plane.
PROTAGONIST: There can’t be passengers –
MAHIR: Norskfreight. They use the hangar
on the west side of the freeport.
PROTAGONIST: You want to crash a transport
plane? What about the crew?
MAHIR: We’ll pop the slides, chuck ’em off
–
40.
PROTAGONIST: On the move?
MAHIR: What’s the problem? They’ll be
fine.
PROTAGONIST: It seems... bold.
MAHIR: (smiles)
‘Bold’ I’m fine with – I thought
you were going to say nuts.
PROTAGONIST: And if you get caught?
MAHIR: We won’t.
PROTAGONIST: If you do?
MAHIR: Everyone assumes terrorism, but no
one’s died. Swift extradition, then
lost in the system. It’ll barely
make the news.
NEIL: That may depend on the size of your
explosion.
MAHIR: Actually, the gold bars might get
some play.
PROTAGONIST: Gold bars?
NEIL: Norskfreight ships treasury gold
once a month.
MAHIR: We blow the back, drop the gold out
on the runway.
NEIL: No one’s going to be looking at
your building, I guarantee you.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, OSLO – DAY

Neil takes LUNGFULS of air, hyperventilating – Mahir starts a
stopwatch. The Protagonist studies some plans...
41.
PROTAGONIST: The space at the centre of the
pentagon’s too big... there’s
something there, not marked.
Neil runs out of air. Mahir checks his watch.
NEIL: A vault within a vault?
PROTAGONIST: Maybe.
MAHIR: Eighty-five seconds.
NEIL: Ample.
MAHIR: Won’t you be running?
(turns to the
Protagonist)
Start packing.
The Protagonist starts BREATHING HARD...

EXT. FREEPORT – NIGHT

The Protagonist and Neil, carrying BRIEFCASES, head inside.

EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

MAHIR: You gonna eat that?
The Guard turns – Mahir GRABS him from behind, Rohan stuffs a
COTTON PAD over the Guard’s face, rendering him unconscious.
They ROLL him into the catering-truck lift... Mahir pops out
and signals ANOTHER GUARD...
THREE GUARDS have been dumped into the truck lift – Rohan
sends it DOWN, SEALS the plane door. Mahir approaches the
cockpit as the PILOTS perform checks – SHOWS THEM HIS GUN...
MAHIR (CONT'D): Alright, lads?

INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Staff Member leads Neil and the Protagonist into the
vaults...

The Staff Member shows Neil and the Protagonist into a vault.
Neil puts down his briefcase – pulls out the framed
documents.

The transport plane BARRELS down the taxiway...
43.

INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Rohan TOSSES the grenade behind the gold at the tail of the
plane and DUCKS as it BLOWS –

Mahir TURNS the stick HARD LEFT, AIMING AT THE REAR WALL OF
THE FREEPORT –:

INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS

Rohan lowers a ladder behind the forward landing gear – he
and Mahir climb down –

EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

Mahir and Rohan jump down onto the asphalt, racing back
between the wheels as the giant plane SMASHES INTO THE BRICK
WALL OF THE FREEPORT, ERUPTING IN A MASSIVE EXPLOSION...

INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The vault is ROCKED by the explosion – ALARMS SCREAM – DOORS
START CLOSING – Neil looks, panicked, at the Staff Member –
44.
NEIL: Ten seconds, right?!
The Staff Member BOLTS – PUSHING PAST THEM – they take a last
gulp of air – GAS HISSES IN. They pull apart the frames of
the documents, BREAKING THEM INTO LOCK-PICKING APPARATUS –
lockpicks, small crowbar – they go to work on the INNER DOOR,
PRYING open a panel – HOT-WIRING it – the door SLIDES UP –

INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

They BURST into the corridor, GASPING – the door SLAMS DOWN
behind them – they HUSTLE down to the next vault door – get
to work. The door opens, they GULP AIR, then RACE inside –

INT. VAULT 2, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

– round the corner past RACKS, CRATES, some BROKEN – stop at
the next door, the Protagonist picks the lock – his PICK
BREAKS – Neil BOLTS back to where they entered – the
Protagonist STRUGGLES, pulling out pieces of the pick – Neil
gets to the first door –
NO HANDLE – the Protagonist uses a different tool – Neil
SMASHES the door, full-blown PANIC – he looks to the end of
the vault where the ROLLER DOOR is BROKEN at the bottom,
halide gas HISSING OUT –
Neil races towards it – the Protagonist gets his door OPEN –
Neil STUMBLES past – the Protagonist DRAGS him through the
door –

INT. INNER CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS

They lie GASPING. Neil hears something, looks around –
NEIL: (urgent whisper)
There’s someone in here with us!
The Protagonist is up, moving down the corridor...
They arrive at two doors, side by side: the Rotas vault. They
each work on a door. Neil’s OPENS –
NEIL (CONT'D): Need a hand?
The Protagonist works his door... nothing.
PROTAGONIST: Actually, yes.
Neil leans over, hits ‘ENTER’, the door OPENS.
45.

INT. ROTAS VAULT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist enters a room, one side of which is a LONG
GLASS WINDOW. Neil is on the other side of the glass, in an
IDENTICAL ROOM. There are BULLET HOLES in the glass. At the
end of each room is a tube, like a sealed in REVOLVING DOOR.
The Protagonist’s feet crunch BROKEN GLASS...
Neil examines BULLET HOLES in the wall opposite the glass.
WISPS of SMOKE gather near the holes – Neil reaches up –
PROTAGONIST: Don’t touch them –
NEIL: What the hell happened here?
The Protagonist sees a STRIPPED AUTOMATIC PISTOL on the
floor. He picks it up, thinking –
PROTAGONIST: It hasn’t happened, yet.
Neil looks at the Protagonist, quizzical – A LOUD HUM STARTS
UP from the revolving door... the Protagonist looks down –
MOVEMENT beneath his feet – the DEBRIS – SMOKE GATHERS – the
revolving doors ROTATE, OPENING – a BLACK-CLAD FIGURE in a
GAS MASK LEAPS BACKWARDS from the tube – reaching behind
itself to GRAB the stripped automatic in the Protagonist’s
hand –
On Neil’s side an identical BLACK-CLAD FIGURE LEAPS out
FORWARDS – knocks Neil over, moving for the vault door –
A SLIDE jumps into the Backwards Figure’s hand – he

jumping up to LOAD IT – BLAM!
A bullet is SUCKED OUT OF THE WALL – THROUGH THE GLASS –
‘HEALING’ THE BULLET HOLES – the Protagonist STRUGGLES with
the Backwards Figure – whose REVERSE MOVEMENTS seem ALIEN and
IMPOSSIBLE –: Neil gives chase – RACING out of the vault door –

46.

INT. ROTAS VAULT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist STRUGGLES – the Backwards Figure PUSHES him
towards the next bullet hole, STRANGE REVERSE GROANING
building in its throat, behind the black gas mask, the GROAN
PEAKING AS the Protagonist takes his PICK and STABS the
Backwards Figure in the arm and SMACKS the Figure’s gun out
of its hand – it BOUNCES out the door –
The Figure RISES into the Protagonist’s arms – PULLS him
backwards – we can’t tell if it’s PUSHING or the Protagonist
is PULLING as they move backwards through the door –

INT. CORRIDOR, VAULT – CONTINUOUS

The Figure PUSHES/PULLS the Protagonist down the corridor –

INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and the Backwards Figure struggle into –

INT. VAULT 2, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

They SMASH into the racks and crates – the Protagonist GRABS
the gun – raises it to the Figure’s head –
NEIL (O.S.): NO! Don’t kill him!
The Protagonist freezes – Neil steps up, DESPERATE –
NEIL (CONT'D): We need to know if you’re
compromised.
The Protagonist THROWS the Figure to the ground –
PROTAGONIST: Why are you here?!
The Protagonist tries to rip off the gas mask, but it is
strapped tight – the REVERSE KEENING gets LOUDER and LOUDER.
The Protagonist STEPS onto the Figure’s injured arm...
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Who sent you?!
47.
The Figure’s reverse screaming gets louder – the Protagonist
KICKS its arm, HARD, AGAIN AND AGAIN –
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): HOW DID YOU KNOW WE’D BE HERE!
A BOOM! from outside – AIR starts BLOWING ACROSS the
Backwards Figure, SUCKING underneath the broken roller door –
the Backwards Figure SLIDES impossibly across the floor and
underneath the door which SLAMS shut, unbroken behind him.
The Protagonist and Neil look at each other...
NEIL: We have to go.

along with DOZENS of other UNIFORMED AIRPORT WORKERS...

NEIL: I took care of him.
The door opens – they slip into the outer vault –

INT. OUTER VAULT, FREEPORT – MOMENTS LATER

They reassemble the document frames, then LIE DOWN,
‘unconscious’ – EMERGENCY SERVICES BURSTS IN...

INT. HOTEL ROOM, OSLO – DAWN

Neil hangs up his phone –
48.
NEIL: Mahir and Rohan slipped out clean.
(turns to the
Protagonist)
I’ve seen too much and I’m still
alive. Which means you’ve decided
to trust me.
PROTAGONIST: Or I’ve lost my edge.
NEIL: Oh, your edge is intact.
The Protagonist looks at Neil.
PROTAGONIST: There’s a cold war.
NEIL: Nuclear?
PROTAGONIST: Temporal.
NEIL: (skeptical)
Time travel?
PROTAGONIST: No. Technology that can invert an
object’s entropy.
NEIL: You mean reverse chronology. Like
Feynman and Wheeler’s notion that
a positron is an electron moving
backwards in time.
PROTAGONIST: Sure, that’s exactly what I meant.
NEIL: I’ve a master’s in physics.
PROTAGONIST: Well, try to keep up.
NEIL: The implications of this are –
PROTAGONIST: Beyond secret.
NEIL: Then why’d you take me in?
49.
PROTAGONIST: I thought we’d find the drawing and
a couple boxes of bullets.
NEIL: You were as surprised as I was.
PROTAGONIST: I’m going back to Mumbai for
answers. I’ll set you up as go-
between. But remember – to you, all
this is about plutonium. Or when
we’re done, they’ll kill you.
NEIL: Won’t you have to anyway?
PROTAGONIST: I’d rather it was my decision.
NEIL: So would I. I think.

INT./EXT. FERRY BOAT, MUMBAI – DAY

The Protagonist boards, approaching Priya at the rail.
PRIYA: I don’t like to leave my house.
PROTAGONIST: And I don’t like bungee jumping.
But we need to talk.
PRIYA: What about?
PROTAGONIST: Inversion.
PRIYA: We spoke about it –
PROTAGONIST: I don’t remember anything about
people being inverted –
PRIYA: We’re trying to do with inversion
what we couldn’t do with the atomic
bomb – uninvent it. Divide and
contain the knowledge. Ignorance is
our ammunition – the more any one
of us knows, the greater the risk
that we’re actually making the
situation worse.
50.
PROTAGONIST: Risk more.
Priya gestures at the paper. A headline: ‘OSLO GOLD FREIGHT
CRASH – TERRORISM? ROBBERY? BOTH?’
PRIYA: Your work?
The Protagonist nods.
PRIYA (CONT'D): What did you find in the vaults?
PROTAGONIST: Two antagonists, one inverted. We
took out the regular one, the
inverted one got away.
PRIYA: Both emerged at the same moment?
PROTAGONIST: Yeah.
PRIYA: They were the same person. You saw
someone re-inverting. Sator’s built
a turnstile in that vault.
PROTAGONIST: Turnstile?
PRIYA: A machine for inverting.
PROTAGONIST: You told me the technology hasn’t
been invented, yet.
PRIYA: It hasn’t. He’s been given it by
the future.
PROTAGONIST: For what?
PRIYA: You’ve the best chance of finding
out.

EXT. MUMBAI STREET – MOMENTS LATER

They walk, BODYGUARDS at a discreet distance.
PRIYA: Have you met him?
51.
PROTAGONIST: I was close.
PRIYA: Get closer.
PROTAGONIST: I’ve been compromised. Unless that
antagonist was a coincidence.
PRIYA: The wife set you up?
PROTAGONIST: Maybe. There’s a good chance I get
killed as soon as I go back in.
PRIYA: This was always a suicide mission –
that’s why they recruited a corpse.
PROTAGONIST: Who did? Who are we working for?
PRIYA: Everyone. Survival. You need more,
consider yourself working for me.
PROTAGONIST: Well, Boss, I need a way to
succeed.
Priya thinks. Looks at the Protagonist. Deciding.
PRIYA: What if you have something he
needs?
PROTAGONIST: Such as?
PRIYA: Plutonium 241. Sator tried to lift
the only loose 241 from under a CIA
team at the opera siege in Kiev. He
got the team, but not the 241.
PROTAGONIST: Who did?
PRIYA: Ukrainian security services. It’s
moving through Tallinn in a week.
52.
PROTAGONIST: Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons-grade plutonium is
unacceptable. I’m just gonna take
him out.
PRIYA: No. Sator has to stay alive until
we know his part in things.
Leverage the situation without
losing control of the 241.
PROTAGONIST: It’s too dangerous.
PRIYA: A terrorist bomb, even one that
kills millions, is nothing compared
with what happens if we don’t stop
Sator.
PROTAGONIST: From. Doing. What?
Priya looks up the road at the cars STREAMING past...
PRIYA: We’re being attacked. Not by
terrorists or rogue states...
PROTAGONIST: Who, then?
PRIYA: We’re being attacked by the future.
And we’re fighting over time.
PROTAGONIST: Time?
PRIYA: Theirs is running out, so they’re
coming for ours. And Sator is
helping. You have to find out how.

EXT. TERRACE, AMALFI COAST – DAY

The Protagonist leaves the tourists behind, heading down a
leafy path to emerge at a terrace overlooking the sea. Kat
stands there, alone. The Protagonist falls in beside her.
KAT: I saw the news from Oslo. Do you
have the drawing?
53.
PROTAGONIST: You don’t have to worry about it
any more.
KAT: You destroyed it?
PROTAGONIST: I didn’t think you’d want it back.
KAT: Does he know?
PROTAGONIST: Not yet, so sit tight.
KAT: Sit tight? Why? Every day my son
spends with that monster, he thinks
a little less of me.
PROTAGONIST: It won’t be long. In the meantime,
introduce me.
KAT: As what?
PROTAGONIST: I’m a former First Secretary from
the American Embassy in Riyadh, we
met at a party last June –
KAT: We were at a party in Riyadh, but I
don’t think it was June –
PROTAGONIST: June 29th. 7 for 7:30, salmon on
the printed menu swapped for sea
bass on the night. Sator left
early, that’s when we met. Don’t
offer any of this, it’s there if he
asks. I came into Shipley’s in
London, you ran into me here and
want to show me the yacht.
KAT: He’ll think we’re having an affair.
PROTAGONIST: And he’ll want to meet me.
KAT: Or have you killed.
PROTAGONIST: Let me worry about that.
54.
KAT: Did I look worried?

EXT. DOCK, AMALFI – DAY

The Protagonist and Kat look out at an enormous yacht.
KAT: Sleeps 70, with crew. Four tenders,
two helicopters, missile defences –
PROTAGONIST: Jesus. Worried about pirates?
KAT: Andrei loves playing one government
off another. The day they turn,
that’s his refuge.
PROTAGONIST: What if I joined you?
She nods at Volkov, holding the launch’s line.
KAT: I’m not sure Volkov’s taking
passengers just now.
PROTAGONIST: Then let’s take mine.
The Protagonist nods at Volkov as they walk past.

EXT. HARBOUR, AMALFI – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist GUNS his boat hard, carving a GLITTERING PATH
across the calm harbour. Kat sits, enjoying the speed.
The Protagonist pulls up alongside the yacht, CREW MEMBERS
SCRAMBLE, unaccustomed to unauthorized approaches. The
Protagonist follows Kat’s gaze to a FIGURE above, but the sun
is behind it. Kat steps onto the yacht.
The Protagonist gives the figure a JAUNTY SALUTE. No
response. The Protagonist ZIPS back towards shore, passing
the yacht’s launch. He waves at Volkov.

INT./EXT. YACHT – MOMENTS LATER

Follow Kat into the enormous lounge. She drops her bags –
MALE VOICE (O.S.): Who’s the American?
55.
She turns. A middle-aged man with cold eyes and a thin beard
stands in the doorway. THIS IS SATOR.
KAT: A friend.
SATOR: The man from Shipley’s?
KAT: Who you tried to have beaten up?
SATOR: I ask again. Who is he?
KAT: We met in Riyadh. In June at the
American Embassy.
SATOR: Good with fists for a diplomat...
KAT: Paranoia’s your department. He
seems nice, I invited him to the
dinner.
(turns away)
Max?... Max?!...
SATOR: He’s visiting Pompeii and
Herculaneum.
KAT: Overnight? You just sent him off?!
SATOR: He’s my son.
KAT: Our son. I told him I’d go with him
–
SATOR: I explained you were busy. With
your friend.
He turns, walks away. She watches him leave.

INT. RESTAURANT, AMALFI COAST – EVENING

The Protagonist walks towards a table where Sator, holding
court, attacks some crabs. Volkov stops the Protagonist and
FRISKS him, in full view of the diners.
56.
PROTAGONIST: Where I’m from, you buy me dinner
first.
Without looking, Sator gestures at a seat, Volkov lets the
Protagonist pass. He sits.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Mr Sator? I’m –
SATOR: (quiet)
Don’t bother. Just tell me if
you’ve slept with my wife, yet.
The Protagonist glances up at Kat, opposite, chatting.
PROTAGONIST: No. Not yet.
A glance from Sator between buttery mouthfuls of crab.
SATOR: How would you like to die?
PROTAGONIST: Old.
SATOR: You chose the wrong profession.
Sator returns a toast from a grinning guest. Reaches a greasy
palm to the Protagonist’s cheek, as if in friendliness...
SATOR (CONT'D): There’s a walled garden up the
road. We’re going to take you
there, cut your throat, not across,
in the middle, like a hole. Then we
take your balls, stuff them in the
cut, block the windpipe.
PROTAGONIST: Complex.
SATOR: It’s gratifying to watch a man you
don’t like try to pull his own
balls out of his throat before he
chokes.
PROTAGONIST: Is this how you treat all your
guests?
SATOR: The ones using my family to get to
me.
57.
PROTAGONIST: How else is someone supposed to get
to you?
SATOR: Only a fool wants to be near me.
PROTAGONIST: Or someone who has something worth
delaying your gratification for...
Sator signals Volkov – Kat glances over as Volkov RISES –
SATOR: We’re finished.
PROTAGONIST: Do you like opera?
At this, Sator pauses. Waves off Volkov.
SATOR: Not here. You sail?
PROTAGONIST: I’ve messed around on boats.
SATOR: Be on the dock at eight. Ready to
do more than mess around.
Kat, relieved, watches the Protagonist leave.

EXT. DINING ROOM, YACHT – MORNING

Kat enters, dressed in sailing gear. Sator is already seated,
similarly dressed, reading his phone, with a cup of coffee.
KAT: Max has missed too much school this
year. I’m taking him back to
England.
SATOR: No, you’re not. He has a tutor
here.
KAT: The school won’t be okay with –
SATOR: Yes, they will.
KAT: Can I finish?!
58.
SATOR: Look around you – he has everything
he needs here.
A SERVANT places a plate with a silver cover in front of Kat,
then pours her coffee.
KAT: You don’t care what he needs. You
bought the trappings of a king, but
we both know you’re a grubby little
man playing power games with a wife
who doesn’t love him any more.
Sator looks at her.
SATOR: You seem spirited today.
KAT: (defiant)
Do I?
Sator barely nods at the servant, who pulls off the lid...
SATOR: Yes. You do.
On the plate, instead of breakfast, is a small drawing. A
‘Rubens’. Kat freezes.
SATOR (CONT'D): Were you worried it had been
destroyed? Rest assured, instinct
told me to remove it from the
vault. I’ve always had instincts
about the future. That’s how I
built this life you no longer
value.
Kat looks up at him, not knowing what to say or do.

EXT. DOCK, AMALFI – MORNING

The Protagonist stands on the dock, dressed for sailing,
watching the launch approach...
PROTAGONIST: Morning.
As he gets on, Kat ignores him. Sator enjoys this.

EXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist tries to catch Kat’s eye, but she will not
look his way.
59.
Sator hands the Protagonist a HARNESS and a HELMET... he
looks at them, taken aback, then looks ahead – towards TWO
GRAPHITE DARK, HIGHEST TECH AMERICA’S CUP SAILING YACHTS,
trimmed and ready.
PROTAGONIST: (impressed)
When you said sailing...

EXT. SAILING YACHT DECK – MOMENTS LATER

Kat gets on, followed by Sator and the Protagonist. The
rigging crew departs. Kat checks the sheets and winches.
Sator indicates the harness.
SATOR: You know how?
PROTAGONIST: Aye, Captain.
Sator gestures at Kat.
SATOR: She’s captain.

EXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI – LATER

The boats FLY, SKIMMING THE WATER ON THEIR HYDROFOILS...
Sator and the Protagonist are next to each other, standing on
one pontoon, LEANING OUT IN THEIR HARNESSES... Kat is at the
wheel, concentrating...
SATOR: What do you know about opera?
PROTAGONIST: In 2008 a remote Russian missile
station was overwhelmed and held
for a week. When the station was
retaken, the plutonium 241 on one
warhead was three quarters of a
kilo lighter. The missing 241
surfaced at the opera-house siege
in Kiev on the 14th.
SATOR: You’re well informed. But that
doesn’t mean you have the
plutonium.
PROTAGONIST: I didn’t say I had it. I’m saying I
know how to get it –
60.
KAT (O.S.):
COMING ABOUT!: Kat SWINGS the boat into the wind, SAIL FLAPPING FURIOUSLY as
the wind catches it on the other side, and Sator and the
Protagonist DUCK under the boom, RACING to the other side,
their harnesses SNAPPING TAUT as they lean out...
SATOR: What do you propose?
PROTAGONIST: Partnership.
SATOR: I wouldn’t partner with you.
Kat works the wheel, tracking the other boat. Her look is one
of BOTTLED RAGE...
PROTAGONIST: What’s wrong with me?
SATOR: You know how to handle yourself,
you have no record.
PROTAGONIST: Someone in the arms trade with
training who covers his tracks? Not
that shocking.
SATOR: For an intelligence agent.
Sator holds the Protagonist’s gaze...
KAT: Secure your jib line.
The Protagonist turns – Kat leans in to Sator –
KAT (CONT'D): Burn in hell, Andrei –
– and YANKS HIS QUICK-RELEASE – he FLIES off the boat,
SMASHING HEAD-FIRST into the waves –
The Protagonist sees Sator FACE-DOWN, UNCONSCIOUS – he
UNCLIPS, JUMPS to the wheel, SPINNING the boat OFF THE WIND –
KAT (CONT'D): YOU CAN’T JIBE A BOAT LIKE THIS – !
The Protagonist STEERS the boat across the wind, SNAPPING THE
BOOM ACROSS, ALMOST LOSING THE MAST –
61.
PROTAGONIST: You can if you have to –
He RELEASES THE SHEETS, SPILLING WIND, LOSING SPEED – as they
pass Sator he DIVES into the water – GRABS the oligarch –
PULLS his face out of the water... Sator starts COUGHING...

INT. STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – DAY

The Protagonist dries himself – the door opens – Kat BURSTS
in –
KAT: WHY DIDN’T YOU LET HIM DROWN?!
She is on him, smashing her fists into his chest –
PROTAGONIST: I need him.
KAT: To sell guns?!
PROTAGONIST: I’m not who you think I am.
KAT: That, I know – he showed me the
drawing.
PROTAGONIST: I’m sorry.
KAT: Do you have any idea what you’ve
done?
PROTAGONIST: I had to get close to him. I don’t
know what you think your husband is
–
KAT: We both know he’s an arms dealer.
PROTAGONIST: He’s so much more.
KAT: What, then?
PROTAGONIST: Andrei Sator holds all our lives in
his hands. Not just yours.
She looks bemused. A KNOCK at the door – she hides behind it
–
62.
VOLKOV: Mr Sator wants to see you.
The Protagonist nods – pushes the door – Volkov stops it –
VOLKOV (CONT'D): Now.
PROTAGONIST: He wants to see me without pants?
Volkov lets the door shut. The Protagonist turns to Kat –
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Trust me.
KAT: Save it. I’m not falling for it
twice.
The Protagonist looks at Kat. Sighs.
PROTAGONIST: You have a better option?
She looks into the Protagonist’s eyes. Assessing.
KAT: Whatever it takes to get what you
want. Just like him. Not a second’s
thought about me. My son. What do
you think he’s going to do to me
now?
He pulls a gun from his bag. Offers it to her.
PROTAGONIST: Try not to use this –
She takes it – lets it point at him.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): On anyone.

INT. STUDY, SATOR’S YACHT – EVENING

The Protagonist is shown in. Sator is sitting behind his
desk. A DOCTOR is taking his blood pressure.
SATOR: Enough –
Sator RIPS the cuff off his arm, sending the doctor out –
checks a fitness tracker on his wrist.
63.
SATOR (CONT'D): See? Pulse of a man half my age.
Drink with me.
Sator pours them both tumblers of vodka.
SATOR (CONT'D): It seems I now owe you my life.
PROTAGONIST: It’s nothing.
Sator fixes his black gaze on the Protagonist.
SATOR: My life is not nothing. And I don’t
like to be in debt.
PROTAGONIST: Then pay me. No retribution against
your wife.
A dangerous beat. Then Sator GRINS –
SATOR: You think she released my harness?
(laughs)
It was my own mistake.
PROTAGONIST: Then help me steal the 241. I need
resources. It’s weapons-grade
plutonium – that means special
handling, containment facilities –
SATOR: I know what it means. You lecture
me about radiation. Andrei Sator,
digging plutonium from the rubble
of my city as a teenager?
PROTAGONIST: Where?
SATOR: Stalsk-12. My home.
Sator sips his drink. Looks the Protagonist in the eye.
SATOR (CONT'D): One pod of a warhead exploded at
ground level, scattering the
others. They needed people to find
the plutonium...
64.
INSERT CUT: IN A DESOLATE STREET, SNOW FALLS ON A HAZMAT-
SUITED SCAVENGER – A YOUNG SATOR WALKING IN FRONT OF A
MASSIVE MINING MACHINE, CARRYING A GIANT CROWBAR AND A GEIGER
COUNTER...:
SATOR (CONT'D): It became my first contract –
nobody else even bid. They thought
it was a death sentence.
INSERT CUT: YOUNG SATOR SPOTS THE MACHINE UNEARTHING A LARGE
METAL CAPSULE. A FELLOW WORKER SEES THE SAME THING...
SATOR (CONT'D): But one man’s probability of death
is another man’s possibility for a
life...
INSERT CUT: YOUNG SATOR OPENS THE CAPSULE. HE LIFTS OUT SOME
PAPERS, WHICH HAVE HIS NAME ON THEM, REVEALING GOLD BARS
UNDERNEATH. THE FELLOW WORKER LEANS IN, STUDYING THE GOLD.
THEY MAKE EYE CONTACT... SATOR STRIKES THE FELLOW WORKER WITH
HIS CROWBAR, KILLING HIM...
SATOR (CONT'D): I staked my claim in the new
Russia. Even now, my company is the
only one to operate in the ruins.
PROTAGONIST: The 241’s being transported through
Northern Europe on its way to the
long-term nuclear storage depot at
Trieste. I’m told you have
resources in Tallinn.
Sator downs his vodka.
SATOR: Stay with us tonight. I insist.

INT. KAT’S STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – NIGHT

Kat slips the gun under her mattress, feels the lump – pulls
it out – moves to the desk, puts it in her jewellery case –
hearing a noise she jumps onto the bed, picks up a book. The
door opens. Sator. He locks the door.
KAT: What do you want, Andrei?
SATOR: We’re going to talk about today.
KAT: No, we’re not.
65.
He removes a DIAMOND CUFFLINK...
SATOR: No?
Kat starts to get off the bed –
KAT: Don’t think for a minute you can
treat me the way you treat your
other women.
Sator shifts to lean on the desk, cutting her off from the
jewellery box. She sits back down. He removes his belt...
SATOR: And how do you imagine I treat
these other women?
Sator slips the cufflink through a belt hole...
SATOR (CONT'D): You think I force them into
conversation?
Sator tests the diamond studded belt against his palm.
SATOR (CONT'D): You want to be quiet? Fine...
He tosses her a pillow.
SATOR (CONT'D): Bite down on that...
Sator moves towards her – she looks at the jewellery box on
the desk – no way around him – Sator looks down at her. She
looks up at his cold eyes...
KAT: Even a soul as blank and brittle as
yours needs a response. Is fear and
pain enough? Because that’s all I
have to offer.
SATOR: Then it’ll have to do.
KAT: Why didn’t you just throw me out?
SATOR: If I can’t have you, no one can.
KAT: At what point do you give up and
kill me?
66.
Sator shrugs, wraps the belt a turn around his fist...
SATOR: Turn over.
KAT: Touch me, I scream so loud he
hears.
SATOR: You think I’d let him interfere?
KAT: If he tried you’d have to kill him.
End of deal. So leave me the fuck
alone.
A KNOCK at the door.
SATOR:
NOT NOW!: But he hears a RUMBLING... Sator, without a word, exits –

EXT. SATOR’S YACHT, AMALFI COAST – NIGHT

Sator GRABS binoculars from one of his men, peering out –
A helicopter EMERGES from the darkness, THUNDERING IN...

INT. GUEST STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist listens to the incoming chopper – pulls on a
black Windbreaker – quietly opens his door...

INT. PASSAGE, BELOW DECKS, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist makes his way, looking for an exit...

EXT. SATOR’S YACHT, AMALFI COAST – CONTINUOUS

The chopper descends to the landing pad – rotors turning as
Sator signals his men to head in...

EXT. SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is on a roof overlooking the helipad...
He watches Sator’s men remove a LARGE, GRUBBY CAPSULE and
take it below as the chopper LIFTS OFF...
67.

INT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist makes his way through the storage area.
Peering through a window, he sees –

INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

Crew gathered around the capsule. Sator enters, wipes dirt
from the latches and opens it. Sator puts his hand over the
open capsule, letting small, flat GOLD BARS leap from the
capsule into his hand... he looks up, expectantly...
The Crew SHOVES a CREW MEMBER forwards, onto his knees...
eyes downcast, he reaches behind – pulls a gold bar from his
rear pocket. He offers it to Sator with TREMBLING hands.
Sator takes it, eyes never leaving the Crew Member... who
finally, tentatively looks up –
BAM! Sator JABS him in the mouth with the gold bar, then
SMASHES him over the head –

INT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is REPULSED by what he sees...

INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

Sator steps back, breathless, from the Small Crew Member, who
lies motionless on the ground.
As Sator raises his wrist to check his fitness tracker, BLOOD
drips from the gold bar in his hand.
SATOR: Ninety-eight. Not bad for such
exertion.

EXT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist SENSES, TURNS – CRACK! Volkov smashes his jaw
– KICKS him in the ribs – pistol-whips him...

INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist, bleeding, is SHOVED into the room –
VOLKOV: He was at the window.
Sator looks at the Protagonist, who nods at the capsule –
68.
PROTAGONIST: I was curious.
SATOR: My property shouldn’t concern you.
Who are you? How do you come by
your information about the opera?
PROTAGONIST: Do I work for intelligence
services? Several, just like you.
You wouldn’t do business with
someone who wasn’t savvy enough to
be recruited. Hell, the CIA
provides two-thirds of the market
for fissile material.
SATOR: They’re usually buying, not
selling. But we do live in a
twilight world...
PROTAGONIST: Is that Whitman? It’s pretty.
SATOR: Next warning’s a bullet in your
brain.
PROTAGONIST: No balls in my throat?
SATOR: There’ll be no time for such things
in Tallinn.
Sator gestures to his men – they lift the capsule. The
Protagonist spots DRIED MUD from the latches on the table...
SATOR (CONT'D): Make your way there. I want Volkov
on the team.
The Protagonist struggles to his feet.
PROTAGONIST: No. I spring the materials, you pay
me off. Your wife does the
exchange.
SATOR: I never involve her in my business.
PROTAGONIST: That’s why I trust her.
69.
SATOR: (to Volkov)
Put him ashore.
PROTAGONIST: How do I contact you?
SATOR: You don’t.
PROTAGONIST: How do you advance me funds?
Sator TOSSES the Protagonist the BLOODY GOLD BAR – the
Protagonist FUMBLES it onto the table. Volkov SNEERS –
SATOR: Handle the plutonium better than
that.
The Protagonist, looking Volkov in the eye, picks up the gold
bar, scooping DRIED MUD into his hand, unseen.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS, TALLINN – DAY

The Protagonist walks the crowded streets with Neil.
PROTAGONIST: What did you find on the gold?
NEIL: Three hundred thousand at today’s
price, no franks, mould marks.
Nothing. Like it came from outer
space.
PROTAGONIST: Or the future.
NEIL: How?
PROTAGONIST: Dead drops. He buries his time
capsule, transmits the location,
then digs it up to collect whatever
inverted material they’ve sent.
NEIL: Instantaneous. Where’s he bury it?
PROTAGONIST: Someplace that won’t be disturbed
for centuries. What did the soil
sample show?
70.
NEIL: Northern Europe or Asia,
radioactive. Dried blood was
European.
PROTAGONIST: Pretty broad.
NEIL: This is the start of the run.
The Protagonist looks back where they came. Then up ahead.
PROTAGONIST: When does the material arrive?
NEIL: Thursday. When does Sator arrive?
PROTAGONIST: I don’t know. But he’ll be here.
NEIL: Cargo’s in a reinforced truck.
Nuclear police front and back –
SUVs with serious armour – you
can’t break in through the windows.
PROTAGONIST: And they can’t break out.
NEIL: I don’t follow.
PROTAGONIST: You will. So, light convoy through
downtown, what’s the thinking?
NEIL: A crowded, unpredictable traffic
pattern makes planning an ambush
almost impossible.
The Protagonist looks around at the congestion.
PROTAGONIST: They have a point. Is the convoy
monitored from the air?
NEIL: No, tracked by GPS – a wrong turn
or an unscheduled stop, in comes
the cavalry.
Neil and the Protagonist hop a tram. The Protagonist studies
the journey along the multi-lane road out of town.
71.
PROTAGONIST: We need big guns, guns that make
the point without being fired. We
need a fast car that doesn’t look
fast and four heavy vehicles, all
different – bus, coach, eighteen-
wheeler...
Neil nods.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): One of them has to be a fire truck.
Neil looks up, interested.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Most of all, we need to set this up
with nothing in the record –
nothing electronic, nothing paper –
I don’t want Sator ambushing us the
second we spring the material. His
ignorance is our only protection.

INT./EXT. MERCEDES ON TALLINN STREETS – DAY

Kat sits beside Sator in the back, staring out the window.
SATOR: Everything salvaged from Oslo’s
been shipped here.
KAT: Why am I here?
SATOR: I don’t trust anyone else to assess
the pieces.

EXT. FREEPORT, DOCKSIDE AREA, EDGE OF TALLINN – DAY

The MERCEDES pulls into the Tallinn Freeport. Several
BODYGUARDS emerge, Sator heads inside. Kat follows, looking
through a metal fence – an AUDI sits there, idling. Its
driver is wearing an OXYGEN MASK...

INT. STORAGE FACILITY, TALLINN FREEPORT – MOMENTS LATER

Kat enters. Sator is at a table covered in WEAPONS.
SATOR: See, Kat? Some of my favourites...
He picks up a MACHINE GUN.
72.
SATOR (CONT'D): Singed but salvageable, wouldn’t
you say?
She stares at the weaponry as if she’s never seen anything
like it before...
KAT: It’s not my area of expertise.
SATOR: That’s right. You’d never have
anything to do with such things.
But this is where our worlds
collide.
KAT: Andrei, what is this?
SATOR: You know perfectly well what it is,
Kat – the filthy business that put
those clothes on your back and our
boy in his school. That you thought
you could negotiate your way
around.
VOLKOV: (in Russian, subtitled)
The convoy’s due downtown in ten.
Sator checks his watch. Nods at Volkov. Turns to Kat.
SATOR: It’s time to go.
KAT: I’m not going anywhere with you.
Sator SLAMS the machine gun back down on the table. Kat
FLINCHES. Sator TURNS, enraged...
SATOR: Look at me and understand – you
don’t negotiate with a tiger – you
admire a tiger, until it turns on
you and you feel its TRUE. FUCKING.
NATURE!: Sator moves towards her – Kat pulls out a gun.
KAT: Don’t...
73.

EXT. TALLINN STREET – DAY

A LARGE UNMARKED TRUCK, with an ESCORT FRONT AND BACK, makes
its stop and-start way through the downtown traffic.

INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and Neil watch the convoy cross an
intersection, then pull forward, squeezing through traffic to
get ahead. Neil raises a walkie-talkie –
YELLOW CO-PILOT: (into radio)
Green? Two minutes.

INT./EXT. GREEN TRUCK, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The GREEN DRIVER nods at the GREEN CO-PILOT who holds the
radio.
GREEN CO-PILOT: Check.
He puts the radio down and pulls out a LARGE AUTOMATIC RIFLE.

INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist checks his watch – Neil speaks into the radio
–
NEIL: Yellow? Sixty seconds.
YELLOW CO-PILOT: (over radio)
Sixty. Check.
NEIL: Blue? Forty-five seconds.
BLUE CO-PILOT: (over radio)
Forty-five. Check.
NEIL: Red? On our way to you.

INT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE – CONTINUOUS

RED DRIVER and RED CO-PILOT are dressed as FIREFIGHTERS.
74.

INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The BMW pulls out, running behind the nuclear convoy. As the
convoy passes the cross street where the green truck, a
FLATBED TRUCK, is sitting, it pulls out beside them, settling
in to the right of the convoy.

INT. STORAGE FACILITY – DAY

Sator steps towards Kat –
KAT: Stay right there!
She lifts the gun, intent –
SATOR: You wouldn’t kill me.
KAT: I already tried.
SATOR: You pushed me off a boat. You’re
not going to shoot me in cold blood
–
KAT: My blood’s not cold, Andrei.
SATOR: No, but you’re not angry enough.
Sator edges towards Kat...
SATOR (CONT'D): Because anger scars over into
despair. I look in your eyes...
He casually GESTURES at her –
SATOR (CONT'D): I see despair.
He SMACKS the gun out of her hands – PUNCHES her – she DROPS
–
SATOR (CONT'D): Vengeful bitch. Living off me,
pretending to be better...
With a primal, animal viciousness, Sator SPITS at Kat.
SATOR (CONT'D):
ENOUGH!: Sator KICKS her once, in the side.
75.
SATOR (CONT'D): You wanted to know when it’s better
to kill you? You’ll have your
answer.
He motions to Volkov, who, with a guard, lifts Kat and
carries her towards the door. Sator puts an earpiece in his
ear...
SATOR (CONT'D): Tell me everything as it happens.
Volkov nods, leaving – Sator walks through a large door.
SATOR (CONT'D): Seal us this side!
As the door shuts behind him, he walks towards a RED DOOR
WITH A SMALL PORTHOLE, finding a spot in the shadows
nearby...

EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The BMW watches the yellow truck, a BROADCAST TRUCK, which
pulls out just ahead of the nuclear convoy... the Protagonist
looks back through the BMW’s side mirror, which is CRACKED...
The BMW sees the blue truck, a WRECKER, which pulls out onto
the larger street, just behind the convoy, which is now
SURROUNDED ON THREE SIDES by the coloured trucks.

INT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS

Volkov follows the convoy...
VOLKOV: (into radio)
Three trucks in place...
SATOR: (over radio)
Watch everything, give me all the
details...

INT. STORAGE FACILITY, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

Sator sits in the shadows, listening intently...

EXT. TALLINN STREETS – CONTINUOUS

The BMW ZIPS ahead, weaving through traffic, pulls alongside
the fire truck.
76.
The Protagonist, DRESSED AS A FIREFIGHTER, jumps out of the
BMW and grabs onto the side of the fire truck, BANGING the
side to signal the driver. The fire truck pulls out onto the
three-lane highway...

INT./EXT. FIRE TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The fire truck pulls alongside the nuclear convoy, slotting
in on the left, so that the convoy is now SURROUNDED... the
Protagonist CLIMBS onto the roof beside the ladder, puts on a
pair of heavy-duty gloves, pulls a diagonal backpack around
onto his front, checking his tools.
Blue Co-pilot and Yellow Co-pilot COUNT DOWN in unison –
BLUE CO-PILOT: (over radio)
Five, four, three, two, one, go...
Blue truck, behind the convoy, GUNS THE ACCELERATOR, as
yellow truck, in front of the convoy, SLAMS ON THE BRAKES...
The two SUVS are ACCORDIONED against the nuclear truck, then
CARRIED FORWARD WITH THE NUCLEAR TRUCK as the coloured trucks
CLOSE FORMATION and PULL FORWARD, maintaining pace –
BLUE CO-PILOT (CONT'D): Go yellow!
The YELLOW CO-PILOT in the broadcast truck sends out STATIC –

INT./EXT. SECURITY SUV – CONTINUOUS

The SECURITY DRIVER is trying the radio – STATIC...

INT. CONTROL CENTRE, TALLINN POLICE – CONTINUOUS

A POLICE OPERATOR is frowning, trying the radio. He calls to
his SUPERVISOR –
POLICE OPERATOR: (in Estonian, subtitled)
– Radio’s down. –
SUPERVISOR: (in Estonian, subtitled)
– Are they still moving? –
The Police Operator checks his screen – NODS...
77.

EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

TYRES HOWLING, the convoy GRINDS forward – Blue Co-pilot
tosses a DYE PACK onto the windshield of the SUV – it BLASTS
across the glass, obscuring the view – Yellow Co-pilot does
the same in the front – the Guards are now BLIND, CANNOT OPEN
THEIR DOORS OR SHOOT OUT THROUGH THE BULLET-PROOF VEHICLES...
The Protagonist CLIMBS ONTO THE LADDER, lying on top...
Inside, the Red Co-pilot operates the ladder controls...
The ladder SWINGS OUT AT NINETY DEGREES, hanging the
Protagonist DIRECTLY OVER THE NUCLEAR TRUCK... he PULLS a
frame from his pack, unfolds it – fixes it to the roof. The
ladder SWINGS him away – the frame EXPLODES – he SWINGS back
through the smoke to find an OPENING and climbs into –

INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist lands, gets his bearings, finds the SAFE. He
reaches into his pack...

EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

An Estonian POLICE CAR pulls up behind the fire truck – the
POLICEMEN spot SPARKS from the dragging bumper of the SUV –
the Policeman Passenger tries his radio... STATIC...

INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist affixes a CHARGE to the safe – he runs a
wire, pushing back into the farthest corner – BLASTS the door
open –

INT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE – CONTINUOUS

Watching the Police through his mirror, Red Passenger rolls
down his window and props his ASSAULT RIFLE on the sill...

INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist reaches into the safe... PULLS OUT an ORANGE
PLASTIC CASE... reaches up to climb through the roof...

INT./EXT. FIRE TRUCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist, orange case in hand, CLIMBS onto the ladder
– Red Passenger SWINGS his rear-opening door out and SHOOTS
OUT the engine block of the police car which DROPS BACK as –
78.
The fire-truck ladder SWINGS the Protagonist back onto the
fire truck – he climbs down onto the side – the BMW pulls
alongside – he JUMPS into the car, which SPEEDS away...

INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

Neil, driving, glances at the orange case –
NEIL: We got it!
The Protagonist opens the latches, flips open the lid...
revealing the BLACK METAL SHAPE the size of a softball.
PROTAGONIST: I’ve seen samples of encapsulation
in every weapons class – this is
not one of them.
Neil looks back at the Protagonist. Serious.
NEIL: It’s what he’s after.
The Protagonist looks around at the surrounding traffic...
PROTAGONIST: Check the radio chatter.
Neil clicks on the radio – EMPHATIC GIBBERISH...
NEIL: I can’t understand –
PROTAGONIST: You said you spoke Estonian –
NEIL: It’s not Estonian, it’s...
backwards –
Up ahead, an Audi is weaving through traffic, towards them,
BACKWARDS... Neil STARES...
NEIL (CONT'D): The hell?
The BACKWARDS-RUNNING AUDI flies at them, CLIPPING the wing
mirror, ‘HEALING’ its crack. Behind them it SPINS AROUND, to
CHASE them, still running BACKWARDS...
The BMW DODGES around traffic, trying to lose the backwards
Audi, which pulls up to the back bumper – then ALONGSIDE – in
the back is Sator, black eyes peering over a RESPIRATOR, a
gun to Kat’s head. She is BOUND and GAGGED, eyes TERRIFIED –
79.
Sator rolls the rear window down, holds up his hand, FINGERS
EXTENDED. He COCKS the gun at Kat’s head then starts COUNTING
DOWN on his fingers... the Protagonist looks down at the
BLACK METAL SHAPE in the case...
NEIL (CONT'D): You can’t give it to him!
The Protagonist LIFTS the closed case, LOWERS the window...
PROTAGONIST: This isn’t plutonium.
Sator is down to TWO FINGERS... Ahead of them in the road,
the Protagonist sees a CRASHED, SMOKING, UPSIDE-DOWN SAAB...
NEIL: It’s worse, goddammit!
Both cars race towards the crashed Saab, which starts SHAKING
as they approach – as they pass, THE CRASHED SAAB ROLLS
VIOLENTLY OVER AND OVER between them until it is on its
wheels, RACING BACKWARDS ahead of them, UNDAMAGED –
Neil regains his line, looks over at Sator who holds up his
LAST FINGER... the Protagonist looks ahead to the Saab,
STRUCK BY AN IDEA... the Protagonist looks at Sator –
Then TOSSES the orange case at him –
The Saab brakes, CUTTING BETWEEN THE TWO CARS...
THE ORANGE CASE GLANCES OFF ITS WINDSHIELD, INTO SATOR’S
HANDS...: A forwards-driving Mercedes pulls up alongside the backwards-
driving Audi. Sator opens the rear door – he and the Audi
driver climb BACKWARDS into the Mercedes – LEAVING KAT IN THE
ACCELERATING BACKWARDS AUDI – the Mercedes DROPS FAR BEHIND
the BMW, Neil WATCHES –
NEIL (CONT'D): He’s getting away!
PROTAGONIST: He left her in the car!
Neil looks forward to the backwards Audi, SPEEDING AWAY –

INT./EXT. BACKWARDS AUDI – CONTINUOUS

NO ONE IS AT THE WHEEL as the car continues to accelerate –
Kat lies in the back, breathing, groaning, but unconscious...
80.

INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist stares ahead at the backwards Audi –
PROTAGONIST: Pull up alongside...
Neil looks back at the receding Mercedes, followed by the
BACKWARDS SAAB... he turns – RACING to pull alongside the
runaway backwards Audi, the Protagonist OPENS his door...
– Ahead, a LOGJAM of traffic...
The Protagonist FUMBLES to open the Audi door.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Kat! Kat!
In the back, Kat swings her bound legs around –
– The LOGJAM of cars and buses LOOMS CLOSER... The
Protagonist OPENS the Audi door, but his own door hits it and
SLAMS IT CLOSED AGAIN...
– The LOGJAM is DANGEROUSLY CLOSE...
The Protagonist OPENS it again, Kat JAMS it open with her
feet – the Protagonist CLIMBS ACROSS and PUSHES THE BRAKE
WITH HIS HAND...: The Audi SKIDS to a halt, the BMW ZOOMING PAST...
The Protagonist starts to untie Kat, fumbling with his radio
–
The BMW SKIDS to a halt, Neil JUMPS OUT – a CAR SKIDS to a
halt between the BMW and the Audi – BLAM, BLAM! Neil DUCKS,
avoiding GUNFIRE –
NEIL: (over radio)
Sit tight – I’m calling in the
cavalry.
PROTAGONIST: What cavalry?!
SMASH!!! The Protagonist and Kat are THROWN LIKE RAG DOLLS
across the car – the Mercedes has SWIPED the nose of the Audi
–
Volkov lays down COVER FIRE, pinning Neil as Sator’s men
descend on the CRASHED Audi and pull the PROTAGONIST out of
the car – shoving him around the back of the Mercedes. Kat is
pulled from the wreck and put into the Mercedes –
As they put the Protagonist INTO THE TRUNK, he sees Sator
MOVING BACKWARDS behind the line of cars, from the BMW...
81.

EXT. DOCKSIDE AREA, EDGE OF TALLINN – MOMENTS LATER

The TRUNK OPENS – the Protagonist is PULLED OUT. Marched
towards an entrance, he sees, through a steel fence dividing
the yard in two, SATOR, IN RESPIRATOR, WALKING BACKWARDS,
PULLING KAT, FORWARDS, TOWARDS A DIFFERENT ENTRANCE...
The Protagonist passes a stack of SHIPPING CONTAINERS,
several of which are marked OSLO FREEPORT...

INT. STORAGE FACILITY, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist is taken past the table of weapons, through a
large door, and through RED DOORS with a PORTHOLE...

INT. TURNSTILE, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

Into A LONG CHAMBER DIVIDED IN TWO BY A GLASS WINDOW – A MUCH
BIGGER VERSION OF THE ROTAS VAULT. The Russians push the
Protagonist into a chair. This side is lit by RED LIGHT.
On the other side of the glass, lit by BLUE LIGHT, Sator
‘ENTERS’ BACKWARDS, ‘PULLING’ Kat, who is now in a
respirator. Sator ‘SHOVES’ her hard into a chair, removes his
own respirator, ‘FLIPPING’ it up onto a hook on the wall.
The Protagonist looks into Kat’s frightened eyes... between
them, embedded in a whirl of cracked glass, is a BULLET...
Sator TURNS to meet the Protagonist’s gaze – his movements
have the surreal edge of backwards motion as he places his
GUN AGAINST KAT’S HEAD and pulls out his phone...
He holds his PHONE up and plays a recording IN REVERSE –
SATOR: (via recording)
If you’re not telling the truth,
she dies.
Sator moves the phone to his lips, SPEAKING IN REVERSE... the
Protagonist stares at him, bemused.
PROTAGONIST: I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
Sator listens to this played backwards...
SATOR: (via recording)
You left it in the car not the fire
truck, right?
PROTAGONIST: Who told you that?
82.
SATOR: (via recording)
Tell me, now! Is it really in the
BMW?:
PROTAGONIST: I don’t know!
SATOR: (via recording)
Tell me or I’ll shoot her again!
The Protagonist looks at Kat, who is TERRIFIED –
KAT: (pleading)
Tell him!
– then at Sator –
PROTAGONIST: Leave her alone!
SATOR: (via recording)
I don’t have time to negotiate.
The Protagonist looks at the bullet hole in the glass – WISPS
OF SMOKE are gathering...
PROTAGONIST: Listen to me! I can help you!
SATOR: (via recording)
Three...
PROTAGONIST: Don’t!
KAT: Help me!
SATOR: (via recording)
Two...
KAT:
PLEASE!: A FAINT TRICKLE of glass dust rises to where the bullet is
lodged in the window...
PROTAGONIST: Wait!
83.
SATOR: (via recording)
One...
Sator LIFTS Kat – PUSHES her up against the glass...
KAT:
PLEASE!:
PROTAGONIST:
NO!: The SMOKE COALESCES as BANG! The bullet RIPS THROUGH KAT’S
SIDE on its inevitable journey to Sator’s gun. Kat SCREAMS –
SATOR: (via recording)
Next one’s a bullet to the head...
He holds up a finger – Kat is SCREAMING –
SATOR (CONT'D): (via recording)
One...
PROTAGONIST: Please!
SATOR: (via recording)
Two...
PROTAGONIST: No!
SATOR: (via recording)
Three...
PROTAGONIST: Okay! Okay! The car! The BMW! I
left it in the BMW!
Kat’s screams subside to moans as she PASSES OUT...
SATOR: (via recording)
We’re going to check this is real.
PROTAGONIST: It’s in the glove box!
The door OPENS behind the Protagonist –
SATOR (O.S.): Where did you leave it?
84.
The Protagonist spins around – Sator, BEHIND HIM, SMASHES his
gun into the Protagonist’s cheek – THIS SATOR IS FORWARDS –
SATOR (CONT'D): Car or truck – which one?!
Sator HITS him again – the Protagonist falls near the glass –
looks up through the glass to see ‘backwards’ Sator, on the
blue side, staring at him dispassionately...
SATOR (CONT'D): Which vehicle did you leave it in?!
I need to know before I go out
there!
PROTAGONIST: I already told you!
Forwards Sator looks through the window at his inverse self –
then turns back to the Protagonist –
SATOR: I believe you...
Sator puts his GUN to the Protagonist’s forehead –
SATOR (CONT'D): (indicates Kat)
You wanted her here. I hope you’ll
be happy together –
Sator COCKS his weapon – BLAMBLAMBLAM! – the double doors
behind the Protagonist SMASH open – PARAMILITARIES BURST IN,
GUNS BLAZING – the two guards are SHOT – Sator JUMPS FOR THE
VAULT – HITS A BUTTON –
On the other side of the glass, INVERTED SATOR runs backwards
towards the other vault door –
BOTH SATORS JUMP INSIDE AND ARE GONE –
A Paramilitary SERGEANT enters, gun drawn –
PARAMILITARY SERGEANT: Clear!
The Protagonist looks at the empty vault –
PROTAGONIST: Where’d he go?
PARAMILITARY SERGEANT: The past.
85.

INT. TURNSTILE, TALLINN FREEPORT – MOMENTS EARLIER

Sator runs out of the turnstile – into the blue side of the
room – on the other side he sees the paramilitary AMBUSH IN
REVERSE... for a few seconds he watches his older self
interrogate the Protagonist, then fires up his phone, steps
up to the glass – the Protagonist SHOUTS PASSIONATELY –
PROTAGONIST: (via recording)
It’s in the glove box!
SATOR: We’re going to check this is real.
PROTAGONIST: (via recording)
Okay! Okay! The car! The BMW! I
left it in the BMW!
The sound of Kat’s MOANING is BUILDING and BUILDING. Sator
holds up one finger –
SATOR: Three...
PROTAGONIST: (via recording)
No!
Adds a second finger – Kat is SCREAMING now –
SATOR: Two...
PROTAGONIST: (via recording)
Please!
And a third –
SATOR: One. Next one’s a bullet to the
head.
Kat’s SCREAM CRESCENDOS as Sator GRABS her and pushes her up
against the glass, PULLS HIS TRIGGER, ‘HEALING’ her wound –
SATOR (CONT'D): One...
PROTAGONIST: (via recording)
Wait!
Holds up two fingers –
86.
SATOR: Two...
PROTAGONIST: (via recording)
Don’t!
Sator holds up three fingers –
SATOR: Three –
PROTAGONIST: (via recording)
Listen to me! I can help you!
SATOR: I don’t have time to negotiate.
The Protagonist looks confused –
PROTAGONIST: (via recording)
Leave her alone!
SATOR: Tell me or I’ll shoot her again!
PROTAGONIST: (via recording)
I don’t know!
SATOR: Tell me now! Is it really in the
BMW!:
PROTAGONIST: (via recording)
Who told you that?
SATOR: You left it in the car not the fire
truck, right?
PROTAGONIST: (via recording)
I don’t know what you’re talking
about.
SATOR: If you’re not telling the truth,
she dies.
Sator GRABS his respirator from the hook, PULLS Kat to her
feet – DRAGS her backwards through the door, down a corridor
into an AIRLOCK, pulls off her respirator, puts his on...
87.

INT. TURNSTILE, TALLINN FREEPORT – THE PRESENT

The Protagonist looks through the glass at Kat –
FEMALE PARAMILITARY: She’s been shot!
PARAMILITARY SERGEANT: Get her this side!
Respirator-clad Paramilitaries pull Kat out of the room. The
Paramilitary Sergeant turns to the Protagonist.
PARAMILITARY SERGEANT (CONT'D): Was she shot with an inverted
round?
The Protagonist NODS. Neil enters – gestures to the Sergeant
–
NEIL: This is Ives. He’s one of us –
The Protagonist GRABS Neil, THROWS him up against the wall –
PROTAGONIST: Us?! Who are these guys?
NEIL: Priya’s. Ours.
The Paramilitaries bring Kat into the room – the MEDIC,
moving SWIFTLY, examines Kat’s wound.
The Protagonist puts his arm AGAINST NEIL’S THROAT –
PROTAGONIST: How did Sator know about the
ambush?
NEIL: Posterity. An ambush on the streets
can’t stay out of the record –
PROTAGONIST: Bullshit – he knew every move we
made! Somebody talked – was it
you?!
NEIL: No.
PROTAGONIST: At every stage, you’ve known more
than you should. I’m asking you one
more time. Did you talk?
88.
IVES (O.S.): Nobody talked. They’re running a
temporal pincer movement.
Ives is next to the Protagonist, ready to help Neil...
PROTAGONIST: A what?
IVES: A pincer movement. But not in space
– in time. Half his team moves
forwards through the event – he
monitors them, then attacks from
the end, moving backwards. Knowing
everything.
PROTAGONIST: Except where I stashed the
plutonium.
The Protagonist lets Neil go...
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Which is not plutonium, is it?
NEIL: I told you – it’s what he’s after.
And you just told him where it is.
PROTAGONIST: I lied.
Neil looks at Kat, bleeding out on the gurney.
NEIL: Jesus.
PROTAGONIST: He couldn’t verify from inside the
room, he’d have shot her anyway.
Lying is standard operating
procedure.
The Medic steps away from Kat, shakes his head.
MEDIC: It’s spread too far.
PROTAGONIST: Meaning what?
IVES: She’s going to die.
NEIL: (to Protagonist)
Standard operating procedure?
(MORE): 89.
(to Ives)
Can’t you stabilize inverse
radiation by inverting the patient?
IVES: That takes days –
The Protagonist points at the turnstile –
PROTAGONIST: Let’s go.
IVES: We took control of this machine
minutes ago – before that it’s
Sator’s.
PROTAGONIST: How long will she live on this
side?
MEDIC: Three hours, tops.
The Protagonist thinks. He looks at Kat, who is dying.
PROTAGONIST: I’m taking her through. I’m not
going to let her die, I’ll take my
chances out there.
IVES: Chances of what? We’ve got no way
to bring you back.
PROTAGONIST: We find another machine.
IVES: A week ago? Where?
The Protagonist looks at Neil – they have the same idea –
NEIL: Oslo.
IVES: That facility’s impregnable. It’s
inside an airport security
perimeter.
PROTAGONIST: Not last week, it wasn’t. We’re
going in. You might as well help.
Ives, shaking his head, joins in. As they carry Kat towards
the vault door, Ives points at the glass partition –
NEIL (CONT'D): 90.
IVES: This is the proving window... as
you approach the turnstile if you
don’t see yourself through the
proving window, do not enter the
machine.
PROTAGONIST: Why not?
IVES: If you haven’t seen yourself
reverse-exit the machine, you won’t
be getting out. Okay, first in,
last out. Get into the turnstile,
pass through – I’ll already be
there with her.
PROTAGONIST: Is that gonna work?
Ives pauses, watching activity on the other side of the
window –
IVES: (points)
Yeah...
The Protagonist turns to see HIMSELF on the other side of the
glass, MOVING IN REVERSE, wheeling KAT ‘TOWARDS’ THE VAULT
DOOR –:
IVES (CONT'D): Let’s go!
Ives OPENS the door – the Protagonist takes one last look at
his backwards self ‘entering’ the machine, then STEPS INSIDE
–
We follow him in as the door SHUTS behind him – he puts his
back to the wall – the machine starts CLANKING like an MRI –
the door opens on the other side – he STEPS OUT...
To see Ives struggling with Kat – he moves to help – Neil is
already there (first in, last out).
The Protagonist looks through the glass to where he and Ives
now appear to be moving backwards...
The Medic tends to Kat.
MEDIC: She’s stabilizing slowly. I’ll
clean and close, the rest is time.
PROTAGONIST: How long does she need?
91.
MEDIC: 4 or 5 days. A week to be sure.
PROTAGONIST: (to Neil)
Figure out how to get us to Oslo –
I’ve got to get back out there –
NEIL: To do what?
PROTAGONIST: To stop Sator getting away with the
whatever it is I just gave him.
NEIL: You didn’t – you lied about where
it was. Wait, you’re going out
there for her.
PROTAGONIST: He threatened to kill her in the
past... if he does, what happens to
her here?
NEIL: It’s unknowable. If you’re there to
make a change, you’re not here to
observe its effect.
PROTAGONIST: What do you believe?
NEIL: What’s happened’s happened. We have
to save her here and now. And if
you go back out there you might
hand him exactly what he’s after.
PROTAGONIST: Don’t let them take her back
through –
NEIL: I won’t.
IVES: You can’t stay here.
NEIL: And we don’t have much time – so
find us a nice cosy shipping
container that just came off a ship
from Oslo...
The Protagonist moves towards the door.  Ives steps up –
92.
IVES: This is cowboy shit. You have no
idea what you’re getting into if
you go through that door.
PROTAGONIST: Well, I’m going, so any tips would
be welcome.
Ives sees determination. Shakes his head.
IVES: Wheeler, brief him.
The female Paramilitary, WHEELER, hands the Protagonist a
respirator –
WHEELER: You need your own air – regular air
won’t pass through the membranes
of inverted lungs. The number-one
rule – don’t come into contact with
your forwards self – that’s the
whole point of these barriers –
Wheeler BANGS on the proving window –
WHEELER (CONT'D): And protective suits – if any of
your particles came into contact –
The Protagonist is putting on the respirator –
PROTAGONIST: What?
WHEELER: Annihilation.
PROTAGONIST: That’s bad, right?
The Protagonist follows Wheeler into a corridor lined with
RESPIRATORS and HAZARD SUITS... at the end is an AIRLOCK...
WHEELER: When you exit the airlock, take a
moment to orient yourself – things
will feel strange. When you run,
the wind will be at your back. If
you encounter fire, ice will form
on your suit, as the transfer of
heat is reversed. Gravity will feel
normal, but appear reversed for the
world around you. Don’t worry about
things falling, so much as rising.
(MORE): 93.
If you see an object demonstrating
unprompted instability, stay clear,
it may be about to leap into the
air. You may experience distortions
to your vision and hearing – this
is normal – light waves and sound
waves are propagating away from
you. This should clear as your
brain adjusts.
PROTAGONIST: Can I drive a car?
IVES: Cowboy shit.
Ives and Neil are grabbing respirators...
WHEELER: I can’t vouch for the handling,
friction and wind resistance are
reversed. You’re inverted, the
world is not. You can’t fight the
prevailing wind of entropy. Don’t
try flying a plane – it’d fall out
of the sky. Once again, you’re
inverted, the world is not – and
those forces will be pushing back
on you continuously.
The Protagonist turns to Neil –
PROTAGONIST: Was there a transponder on the
case?
NEIL: He’ll have tossed the case –
PROTAGONIST: I’m going backwards – that’s the
ball I have to follow. Give me the
reader.
Neil hands him a phone. The Protagonist sticks a Bluetooth
earpiece in his ear, passes into the airlock – Wheeler shuts
it behind him. Then opens the OUTER DOOR...

EXT. YARD, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist emerges into a strange world – the air feels
different, the friction of his feet on the asphalt feels
different. He looks up at birds flying backwards... at steam
contracting... at a pile of dust sucking itself bigger...
In the yard he spots the SAAB... he runs over, finds the keys
sitting on the front tyre –
WHEELER (CONT'D): 94.

INT./EXT. SAAB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist LOOKS in the glove box – NOTHING – LOOKS in
the wheel well – NOTHING – the back seat – NOTHING. He gives
up – starts the engine... pulls out, gently, feeling out the
strange handling of the vehicle...

INT./EXT. SAAB, TALLINN STREETS – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist steers the car around BACKWARDS-MOVING
TRAFFIC and BACKWARDS-WALKING PEDESTRIANS, MARVELLING...
People STARE at the car as it approaches, as if they already
know a backwards-driven car is heading their way (which, of
course, they do).
He checks the phone – a blinking dot half a mile away – he
GUNS it, FISHTAILING unexpectedly...

EXT. HIGHWAY – CONTINUOUS

We see the fire fight from before IN REVERSE – Neil laying
down fire from between cars, Kat carried ‘back’ to the
Audi...
Behind Neil, Sator, MOVING FORWARDS, checks the glove
compartment of the BMW... NOTHING. FUMING, he heads back to
the Mercedes, DUCKING behind cars, bullets FLYING...

INT./EXT. SAAB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist pulls onto a busy highway where the cars are
FACING HIM, BUT MOVING IN HIS DIRECTION...
The Saab races along, the only normal-looking car on a road
full of cars SPEEDING BACKWARDS...
On the phone, the flashing dot is CLOSER...
Slowing, the Protagonist spots the ORANGE CASE lying empty by
the side of the road. He PULLS OVER some distance away –
JUMPS out of the car – pulls out his BLUETOOTH EARPIECE and
WEDGES it between the foam padding and the orange plastic...
The Protagonist heads back to his car, checks the signal from
his phone... PEERS at the case...
The case SHUDDERS TO LIFE – LEAPS INTO THE WINDOW OF A
PASSING CAR – THE MERCEDES –
The Protagonist PEELS OUT, DUST FLIES UP IN CLOUDS THAT DON’T
FULLY BLOSSOM as expected, but CONTRACT...
The Protagonist STRUGGLES with the wheel, trying to keep the
car on the road with its unaccustomed handling...
95.
PROTAGONIST: Christ!
He can see the Mercedes up ahead, weaving through traffic...

EXT. HIGHWAY, TALLINN – CONTINUOUS

The Mercedes races back up the off-ramp – the Saab follows,
weaving through traffic which faces him, but travels
backwards –
As the Saab gets within a couple car lengths, his phone cuts
in with audio from his Bluetooth bug in the Mercedes –
SATOR: (over radio)
– the material’s not in the case –
Sound cuts in and out – FRAGMENTS of voices – he struggles to
keep pace with the Mercedes – he listens hard –
SATOR (CONT'D): (over radio)
–Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocentre– –He
was lying– –it wasn’t in the BMW–
INVERTED DRIVER: (over radio)
So where is it?

INT. /EXT. SAAB – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist finds a clear lane and guns the engine,
tracking the Mercedes as it pulls alongside the Audi, racing
‘forwards’, and Sator, orange case in hand, climbs from the
Mercedes into the Audi...
The Audi pulls alongside the BMW – the Protagonist, sensing
the moment, LOWERS HIS WINDOW... Sator lifts the orange case,
BUT HIS EYES ARE ELSEWHERE –
Inside the Saab, the Protagonist hears BANGING – the BLACK
METAL SHAPE ‘unwedges’ from where it’s been stuck down the
side of a seat – ‘BOUNCING’ around the interior –
The Saab CUTS between the Audi and the BMW –
The orange case FLIES OUT OF SATOR’S HANDS – BOUNCES OFF THE
SAAB’S WINDSHIELD, ‘LANDING’ IN THE BMW –
JUST AS THE BLACK METAL SHAPE JUMPS OUT OF THE SAAB AND INTO
THE (FORWARD) PROTAGONIST’S LOWER HAND...
96.
Sator, SEEING THIS, YANKS the wheel – CLIPS the Saab – the
Protagonist STRUGGLES for control – but the Saab SPINS AND
ROLLS DOWN THE HIGHWAY, COMING TO REST ON ITS ROOF.
The Protagonist, upside down in the car, regains
consciousness... fuel leaks, pooling outside the window... he
sees expensive shoes approach, then Sator’s face peering in
at him. In his hand is a LIGHTER.
SATOR: I saw the hand-off. You made me
shoot her for nothing.
Sator tips his lighter to read his fitness tracker...
SATOR (CONT'D): You did get my pulse above 130. No
one’s done that before. Not even
my wife.
Backing away, Sator DROPS the lighter, the fuel EXPLODES,
THROWING THE CAR SIDEWAYS – BUT INSTEAD OF FULLY BLOOMING,
THE FLAMES CONTRACT, SPARING THE PROTAGONIST WHO LIES THERE,
FREEZING. HE PASSES OUT.
FADE IN::

INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER – LATER

The Protagonist comes to on a stretcher. Kat is on a
stretcher next to him. Neil sits between them. The
Protagonist looks at his hands, feels his face, confused.
NEIL: The heat transfer was reversed –
you may be the first case of
hypothermia from a gasoline
explosion in history.
PROTAGONIST: At this point, nothing surprises.
The Protagonist looks around the shipping container.
NEIL: You left Ives and his team one hell
of a clean-up.
PROTAGONIST: We’re on our way back to Oslo?
NEIL: In a Rotas shipping container.
PROTAGONIST: He’s got the material, Neil. I
handed it to him on a plate.
97.
NEIL: I warned you –
PROTAGONIST: ‘What’s happened’s happened.’ I get
it, now. But it’s tough to take
things on trust from people
speaking half-truths.
NEIL: That’s not fair –
PROTAGONIST: You were part of this before we
met. Were you working for Priya?
NEIL: No.
PROTAGONIST: Who recruited you, Neil?
NEIL: It can’t possibly do you any good
to know that right now. When this
is over, if we’re still standing
and you still care, you can hear my
life story, okay?
Kat GROANS, her eyes flicker open to see the Protagonist.
PROTAGONIST: I’m sorry I involved you.
KAT: You need to tell me what’s going
on.
PROTAGONIST: Apparently, Neil here knows more
about it than I do.
(to Neil)
Good luck, pal.
NEIL: By telling Kat anything we’re
compromising her in Priya’s eyes.
PROTAGONIST: In Priya’s eyes she’s already
compromised. And she has a right to
know why she might die.
KAT: I’m going to die?
98.
PROTAGONIST: Not if we have anything to say
about it.
NEIL: And we do.
KAT: Who are you?
NEIL: Let me start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics operates the
same forwards and backwards, except
one. Entropy...
The Protagonist moves to the back of the container, pulls out
his phone, checks Neil’s attention is on Kat...
SATOR: (via recording)
–bring– –final section– –directly
to the hypocentre– –with the other
parts– –the algorithm–
The recording breaks up. The Protagonist puts the phone away,
FLEXES his elbow, feeling out some pain... He rolls up his
sleeve – there is a DARK PATCH of skin forming –
NEIL: Are you injured?
PROTAGONIST: What’s the ‘algorithm’, Neil?
NEIL: The 241 is one section of it. One
out of nine. It’s a formula
rendered into physical form so it
can’t be copied or communicated. A
black box with one function.
PROTAGONIST: Which is?
NEIL: Inversion. But not objects or
people. The world around us.
KAT: I don’t understand.
NEIL: As they invert the entropy of more
and more objects...
Neil holds his hands, fingers spread, pointing at each other
–
99.
NEIL (CONT'D): The two directions of time are
becoming more intertwined...
He slowly brings his fingers together, into the ‘Tenet’
gesture –
NEIL (CONT'D): But because the environment’s
entropy flows in our direction...
He pushes one hand back with the other –
NEIL (CONT'D): ...we dominate. They’re always
swimming upstream. It’s what saved
your life – the inverted explosion
was pushing against the
environment.
PROTAGONIST: Pissing in the wind.
NEIL: But the algorithm can change the
direction of that wind. It can
invert the entropy of the world.
KAT: And if that happens?
NEIL: Oh, end of play.
PROTAGONIST: ‘End of play’? Can you be a little
more precise?
NEIL: Our present wiped out, our past
obliterated. Everyone and
everything who ever lived destroyed
instantly. Precise enough?
KAT: Including my son.
Neil nods, gravely. Kat winces, clearly in pain.
NEIL: Let me sedate you – the more you
sleep the faster you’ll heal.
Neil injects Kat in the arm. Her eyes close.
100.

EXT. CARGO SHIP – LATER

Close on the hull, we see the water UNSPLASHING at the bow
and SUCKING UNDERNEATH the stern as the ship steams
majestically backwards through the cold North Sea...

INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER – LATER

BANGING wakes the Protagonist – Neil is at a peephole.
NEIL: We’re on a truck. Shouldn’t be too
long now.

INT. SHIPPING CONTAINER – LATER

Neil is awake. He looks over at the Protagonist, who is
examining a LESION on his right arm...
NEIL: You in pain?
PROTAGONIST: Must’ve got nicked in Tallinn.
(rolls down sleeve)
I’ve been thinking... we’re their
ancestors. If they destroy us,
won’t that destroy them?
NEIL: Bringing us to the grandfather
paradox.
PROTAGONIST: The what?
NEIL: The classic thought experiment – if
you went back in time and killed
your own grandfather, how could you
have been born to commit the act?
PROTAGONIST: What’s the answer?
NEIL: There is no answer, it’s a paradox.
But in the future, those in power
clearly believe that you can kick
Grandpa down the stairs, gouge his
eyes and slit his throat without
consequence.
PROTAGONIST: Could they be right?
101.
NEIL: It doesn’t matter. They believe it,
so they’re willing to destroy us.
Can I go back to sleep?
PROTAGONIST: No. I thought of something else.
NEIL: Great.
PROTAGONIST: This reversing the flow of time...
doesn’t us being here now mean it
never happens? That we stop them?
NEIL: Optimistically, I’d say that’s
right.
PROTAGONIST: Pessimistically?
NEIL: In a parallel-worlds theory, we
can’t know the relationship between
consciousness and multiple
realities. Does your head hurt yet?
PROTAGONIST: Yes.
NEIL: Try sleep.

INT. SAME – LATER

A final THUD, then STILLNESS. The Protagonist moves to the
peephole, unplugs it and peers out: The WRECKED PLANE, FLOODLIT, sitting outside the COLLAPSED
WALL which has been sealed with STEEL FENCING.
PROTAGONIST: Shit. They didn’t take us inside.
NEIL: What do we do?
PROTAGONIST: We use the breach. The chaos right
after impact. Get ready.
They both turn to look at the unconscious Kat.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Is she healed enough?
102.
NEIL: I don’t know. I’ve never done this
before.

INT. SAME – NIGHT

The Protagonist is at the peephole – the ground is WET. CLEAN-
UP CREWS and INVESTIGATORS swarm backwards over the scene.
SIRENS start... Water FLOWS UP ONTO THE PLANE’S WINGS. FIRE
CREWS ‘unpack’ their equipment around the wreck...
PROTAGONIST: Fire crew’s there...
The Protagonist WINCES as he pulls his arm into its sleeve...
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): We get Kat through the breach, I
take care of Sator’s man and secure
the vault. Then you bring her in.
NEIL: How’s the arm?
PROTAGONIST: Not good.
The Protagonist spots a HOLE in the fabric of his black suit
– directly over the lesion on his arm...
Neil straps a respirator to the gurney – puts the mask over
Kat’s face, then puts another on himself. He gives Kat a
sedative.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): We move the second we hear the
engines.
Neil looks at Kat, unconscious on the gurney. He TIGHTENS the
straps – throws a reflective blanket over her...
The SIRENS are DEAFENING – the Protagonist flexes his arm,
clearly in a lot of pain. Neil spots BLOOD dripping from the
Protagonist’s wrist –
NEIL: You’re bleeding. Let me take a look
–
SUDDENLY THEY HEAR THE BUILDING WHINE OF JET ENGINES. The
Protagonist YANKS up the handle, THROWS OPEN THE DOOR –
103.

EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS

Onto PANDEMONIUM – FIRE CREWS BATTLE the blaze, chunks of
metal on the ground IGNITE, SHUDDER and LEAP ONTO THE
AIRFRAME... STREAMS of water RISE up onto the plane –
The Protagonist HURRIES BACKWARDS, PULLING THE GURNEY towards
the plane, steering around debris that might suddenly –
A SHEET OF FLAMING METAL SPINS off the ground, shearing into
them, KNOCKING the GURNEY – they duck, HOLDING ON TO THE
GURNEY, the metal FLIES into the air, SLAMS into its hole on
the side of the plane... the Protagonist spots a line under
the fuselage, between flames, towards the breach...
PROTAGONIST: Come on!
Neil looks up as BLACK SMOKE GATHERS, FORMING A MASSIVE CLOUD
OVER THE PLANE... a SHOCK WAVE starts to BUILD in the air
around them – the Protagonist PULLS Kat and Neil under the
fuselage as CURTAINS of FIRE start GATHERING around the
wings, CENTRED on a HALF-DESTROYED JET ENGINE –
They pass through the hole in the wall LICKED AT BY FLAMES
WHICH LEAVE FROST ON THEIR CLOTHES –
As they clear into the building, DEBRIS in front of them
start SHAKING – they DUCK as the MASSIVE BUILD OF ENERGY
CLIMAXES in a CACOPHONOUS REVERSE EXPLOSION as THE JET ENGINE
REASSEMBLES – LOOSELY ATTACHED TO THE WING, THRUSTING –

INT./EXT. FREEPORT SHIPPING AREA – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist draws his gun – turns to Neil –
PROTAGONIST: I’m going in. Wait here.
The Protagonist turns, rushing up onto the loading dock –
The LOOSE JET ENGINE, under FULL THRUST, ATTACHED to the
wing, SWINGS BACK AND FORTH, wreaking REVERSE HAVOC...
The Protagonist pauses, LISTENING – he can hear BACKWARDS
VOICES on the other side of a ROLLER DOOR – the loose jet
engine TURNS, BLASTING AIR at the Protagonist with its
INVERTED THRUST – the Protagonist is SMASHED through the
bottom of the roller door –
104.

INT. VAULT, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

INTO HIMSELF AND NEIL, DRESSED AS BUSINESSMEN AS IN THEIR
EARLIER VISIT TO THE ROTAS VAULT – the Protagonist (wearing
black clothes and gas mask) TACKLES the EARLIER PROTAGONIST
(wearing business suit), the Earlier Protagonist THROWS the
Protagonist onto the ground, getting his gun –
SHOUTING at him INCOMPREHENSIBLY – KICKING his INJURED ARM
AGAIN AND AGAIN – the Protagonist SCREAMS... The Earlier
Protagonist puts his GUN TO THE PROTAGONIST’S HEAD... EARLIER
NEIL GRABS HIS ARM, RESTRAINING him...
The Protagonist and Earlier Protagonist STRUGGLE, ROLLING
across the floor with the unique physics of forward action
merged with backwards action...
They STRUGGLE through the BLUE DOOR of the Rotas vault. The
Protagonist gets his gun – the Earlier Protagonist STABS him
in the arm with his lockpick – ‘HEALING’ his wound –
ENERGIZING him –
He FLIPS the Earlier Protagonist up against the glass, LIFTS
his gun – SHOOTS past the Earlier Protagonist’s head, putting
a BULLET HOLE through the glass –
Glancing at the OPEN TURNSTILE DOOR, the Protagonist FIRES
again, forcing the Earlier Protagonist TOWARDS the door... he
looks through the proving window – no one there...
PROTAGONIST: Come on, come on...
The Protagonist FIRES AGAIN AND AGAIN, forcing the Earlier
Protagonist closer and closer to the open turnstile...
The Earlier Protagonist takes hold of the gun – the barrel
coming around onto the Protagonist who instinctively EJECTS
the magazine, REMOVES the SLIDE, tossing it aside, leaving
the Earlier Protagonist with a useless STRIPPED AUTOMATIC –
Earlier Neil RACES backwards into the other half of the room
– Through the bullet-riddled glass the Protagonist sees
HIMSELF (GAS MASK, BLACK CLOTHES) RUN BACKWARDS into the room
–
The Protagonist LEAPS INTO THE TURNSTILE – we FOLLOW the
Protagonist through the machine – BURSTING OUT on the other
side – straight into Earlier Neil, who now MOVES FORWARDS as
the Protagonist PUSHES past –
As the confrontation on the other side of the glass plays out
again, FORWARDS... the Protagonist RACES for the RED DOOR,
Neil in PURSUIT –
105.

INT. VAULT CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist runs, pursued by Earlier Neil, skidding
around the corners of the vault corridor –
Earlier Neil gets a hand on the Protagonist’s GAS MASK and
YANKS – it comes off in his hands... this time we see that
Neil is looking at the UNMASKED PROTAGONIST. Neil, surprised,
turns and BOLTS back the way he came – the Protagonist
watches him go, then TURNS –

INT. VAULT CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist races down the angled corridor –
The Protagonist SKIDS through the doorway leading out of the
corridor and into the SMOKE-FILLED cargo area where he
left...

INT. VAULT 2, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS

Neil races up to the Earlier Protagonist, grab his arm –
NEIL: NO! Don’t kill him!

INT./EXT. FREEPORT SHIPPING AREA – CONTINUOUS

...Neil (respirator on) guarding Kat, STRAPPED to the gurney.
Behind them, the fire crew battle the blazing plane. Neil is
already looking up at the Protagonist who POINTS right – The
Protagonist DUCKS THROUGH the breach, into the chaos... Neil
moves BACKWARDS towards the outside...

EXT. BREACH – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist RUNS THROUGH THE SMOKE AND FLAME, DODGING
DEBRIS FALLING FROM THE PLANE... heading towards the
EMERGENCY SERVICES...: The Protagonist CREEPS along the side of an AMBULANCE... the
AMBULANCE DRIVER spots him in the mirror – the Protagonist
DARTS in, HITTING the driver in the face –

INT. VAULT CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS

Neil (moving FORWARDS) ducks back behind the corner as
Earlier Protagonist (business suit) and Earlier Neil
(business suit) walk backwards away from the Rotas vault.
Neil pushes Kat towards the broken roller door and pushes her
inside...
106.

EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist SWERVES the ambulance, trying to get close to
the breach – the Protagonist SPINS the ambulance around as
close to the breach as possible. He JUMPS out – opens the
back – PEERS into the smoke and water... waiting...
Neil EMERGES, pushing the gurney with Kat on –

INT./EXT. AMBULANCE – MOMENTS LATER

The Protagonist DRIVES, sirens blaring.
PROTAGONIST: You knew it was me coming out of
that vault. Why didn’t you say?
NEIL: That’s a lot of explaining when
someone’s about to put a bullet in
their own brain.
PROTAGONIST: But afterwards –
NEIL: With things the same, I knew you’d
be okay. What’s happened happened.
If I’d told you and you acted
differently... who knows? The
policy is to suppress.
PROTAGONIST: Whose policy?
Neil GRINS, offering his hand –
NEIL: Ours, my friend. We’re the people
saving the world from what might
have been...

INT./EXT. PARKED AMBULANCE – NIGHT

Neil and the Protagonist are in the back, checking on Kat...
whose eyes OPEN.
PROTAGONIST: Kat?
KAT: I’m here.
Neil checks the dressing on her wound –
107.
NEIL: Be quite a scar, but you’re okay.
We did it.
KAT: Did what? Andrei’s got the
algorithm. You don’t know where he
is –
Neil looks at the Protagonist –
NEIL: Or when.
PROTAGONIST: Get Priya here to Oslo.
NEIL: Why?
PROTAGONIST: If I don’t do something now, in two
days she’ll tell me about the 241.
NEIL: Nothing can change that.
PROTAGONIST: We’ll see. Just get her here.

EXT. OSLO WAR MEMORIAL – DAY

The Protagonist makes his way through the crowd, following an
elegantly dressed lady... Priya. He takes her by the arm,
away from the crowd...
PROTAGONIST: Hello, Priya.
PRIYA: What’s going on? Where’s Neil?
PROTAGONIST: Nursing Katherine Barton. Who
almost died because of you.
PRIYA: What did I do?
PROTAGONIST: It’s what you’re going to do. In
two days you’re going to have me
dangle plutonium 241 in front of
the world’s most dangerous arms
dealer... I want to know why.
108.
PRIYA: You let him get hold of 241?
PROTAGONIST: No. I let him get hold of the
algorithm.
Priya looks at the Protagonist, surprised he knows the term.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Tell me about it, Priya.
PRIYA: It’s unique. The scientist who
built it took her own life so she
couldn’t be forced to make another.
PROTAGONIST: A scientist in the future?
PRIYA: Generations from now.
PROTAGONIST: Why did she have to kill herself?
PRIYA: You’re familiar with the Manhattan
Project? As they approached the
first atomic test, Oppenheimer
became concerned the detonation
might produce a chain reaction,
engulfing the world.
PROTAGONIST: They went ahead anyway, and got
lucky.
PRIYA: Think of our scientist as her
generation’s Oppenheimer – she
devises a method for inverting the
world, but becomes convinced that
by destroying us, they destroy
themselves.
PROTAGONIST: The grandfather paradox.
PRIYA: Unlike Oppenheimer, she rebels,
splitting the algorithm into nine
sections and hiding them the best
place she can think of...
PROTAGONIST: The past. Here. Now.
109.
PRIYA: There are nine nuclear powers. Nine
bombs. Nine sets of the most
closely guarded materials in the
history of the world. The best
hiding places possible.
PROTAGONIST: Nuclear containment facilities.
PRIYA: Sator’s lifelong mission, financed
and guided by the future, has been
to find and reassemble the
algorithm.
PROTAGONIST: Why did they choose him?
PRIYA: The necessary combination of greed
and ambition. But mostly, he was in
the right place at the right time.
PROTAGONIST: The collapse of the Soviet Union.
PRIYA: The most insecure moment in the
history of nuclear weapons.
PROTAGONIST: And there he was. How many of the
sections does he have?
PRIYA: After the 241? All nine.
PROTAGONIST: Christ. And that’s why you’re going
to do it differently this time.
PRIYA: To change things? So Katherine
won’t get hurt?
PROTAGONIST: So Sator won’t get the algorithm.
PRIYA: If that universe can exist, we
don’t live in it.
PROTAGONIST: Let’s try. You’re going to warn me.
110.
PRIYA: No. I’m not. Ignorance is our
ammunition. If you’d known what the
algorithm was, would you have let
it fall into Sator’s hands?
PROTAGONIST: You want him to get the last
section?
PRIYA: It’s the only way he’ll bring
together the other eight.
PROTAGONIST: I was supposed to steal it, then
lose it?
PRIYA: (smiles)
Mission accomplished.
PROTAGONIST: You used me.
PRIYA: As you used Katherine. Standard
operating procedure. You’ve done
your part.
PROTAGONIST: My part? I’m the protagonist of
this operation –
PRIYA: You’re a protagonist.
(off look)
What? You thought you were the only
person capable of saving the world?
PROTAGONIST: No. But I am. Because I haven’t
told you where he’s assembling the
algorithm, or when.
PRIYA: You’re about to.
PROTAGONIST: No, I’m not. So deal us in.
PRIYA: Why would you involve her again?
PROTAGONIST: She can get close to him.
111.
PRIYA: Does he still trust her?
PROTAGONIST: He thinks she’s dead. But he used
to.
PRIYA: You have started looking at the
world in a new way.
PROTAGONIST: And now it’s your turn. Assuming
she makes it out alive, whether or
not you feel she knows too much...
PRIYA: I can’t.
PROTAGONIST: If you don’t have the authority,
talk to whoever’s in charge of
loose ends. I need your word that
she and her son will be safe.
PRIYA: (frustrated)
What good is someone’s word in our
line of business?
The Protagonist just looks at her. She NODS.
PRIYA (CONT'D): They’ll be safe. There’s a rally
point offshore at Trondheim. Get
yourselves up there...

EXT. WIND FARM, NORWAY – DAY

Chinooks cross BACKWARDS through WHITE TURBINES. Service
boats pull people off ladders. A large ICEBREAKER sits nearby
–

EXT. ICEBREAKER, BARENTS SEA – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist, IN RESPIRATOR, does PULL-UPS on deck, the
movement ‘shaking’ snow back up onto the pipe...
PRIYA (V.O.): Ives has a team ready to invert.
CUT BACK TO THE PROTAGONIST IN OSLO –
112.
PROTAGONIST: You have a turnstile? The exact
technology we’re trying to
suppress?

EXT. ICEBREAKER – DAY

The Protagonist watches a CHINOOK long-line a container...
PRIYA (V.O.): Fighting fire with fire is a
treacherous business, but there are
people in the future who need us to
continue the algorithm’s journey
into the past. You see...
Taking a look at the sea CHURNING BACKWARDS into the stern as
the inverted ship ‘progresses’, he heads below deck...
CUT BACK TO PRIYA IN OSLO –
PRIYA: ...Tenet wasn’t founded in the past
– it will be founded in the future.

INT. HOLD, ICEBREAKER – CONTINUOUS

Coming out of an AIRLOCK, he removes his respirator. Walks
past Wheeler drilling TENET SOLDIERS – non-inverted soldiers
in respirators SPAR with inverted soldiers. Neil is amongst
troops practising ‘LIFTING’ weapons from the floor.

INT. CABIN, ICEBREAKER – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist enters. Kat sits at a window.
KAT: I can’t get over the birds...
The Protagonist follows her look to a bird flying backwards.
PROTAGONIST: How are you feeling?
She lifts her shirt to reveal a LARGE, JAGGED, ANGRY SCAR.
KAT: Tell me you’re going to kill him.
PROTAGONIST: I can’t.
Neil enters without interrupting. Kat rises. Steady.
113.
KAT: Why not? I think you’ve probably
killed a lot of people –
NEIL: Not with a dead man’s switch.
KAT: A what?
PROTAGONIST: That fitness tracker he wears...
KAT: He’s obsessive about his health.
NEIL: It’ll be linked to a switch.
Probably a simple email burst,
revealing the location of the dead
drop, set to fire if his heart
stops.
PROTAGONIST: In effect, his death activates the
algorithm. He dies, the world ends
– no one dares kill him.
Kat realizes...
KAT: No, you’ve missed the point. He’s
intending to end his life.
PROTAGONIST: Why?
KAT: He’s dying. Inoperable pancreatic
cancer.
PROTAGONIST: And he’s taking the world with him.
KAT: If he can’t have her, no one can.
PROTAGONIST: What?
KAT: Something he said, once. He has a
child, for God’s sake.
NEIL: Kat, he gets to choose the time and
place for the end of the world.
What moment? What does he choose?
114.
PROTAGONIST: You told me about a holiday, where
you let him feel loved...
KAT: Viet Nam. On our yacht. His yacht.
PROTAGONIST: You said he vanished – what day?
KAT: I went ashore with Max, he flew
off. I don’t know what date it
was...
NEIL: The 14th. Ten days ago. He was in
Ukraine, stealing a section of the
algorithm from an American team.
PROTAGONIST: At the Kiev Opera siege. How do you
know about that?
NEIL: The point is – he wasn’t on the
yacht, so that’s his window.
KAT: To come back to that golden moment
and have it be his last.
PROTAGONIST: Everyone’s last. We have to lift
the algorithm from the dead drop
without Sator knowing. If he
believes it’s in there, he kills
himself.
NEIL: And not the rest of us. Where’s the
dead drop?
PROTAGONIST: Knowledge divided, friend.
NEIL: You’re not going to tell me?
PROTAGONIST: Ignorance is our ammunition.
(turns to her)
But I need you back on that boat.
KAT: Why?
115.
PROTAGONIST: You have to stop him killing
himself until we know that
algorithm is out of the dead drop.
KAT: But if I’m caught there... and my
son sees... I don’t want those
moments full of anguish if they’re
going to be his last.
PROTAGONIST: They’re not.

INT. ICEBREAKER, BARENTS SEA – DAY

The Protagonist watches the troops prepare.
IVES (O.S.): Cough it up. It’s time.
The Protagonist turns to face Ives.
IVES (CONT'D): We’re working our way back to the
14th. But without knowing where
the dead drop is, there’s only so
much I can prepare.
(no response)
You need me to get you there.
PROTAGONIST: Know what a hypocentre is?
Ives shakes his head.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): Ground zero for an underground
nuclear test. Sir Michael Crosby
told me about a detonation at
Stalsk-12 on the 14th – the dead
drop is at the bottom of the
hypocentre. That explosion seals up
the algorithm.
IVES: Then we’d better pull it out of
that hole before the bomb goes off.

INT. TURNSTILE, ICEBREAKER – DAY

Soldiers in respirators file into the turnstile. Through the
proving window we see them ‘back’ into the exit... The
Protagonist checks his gear at the back of the line. He sees
Kat watching from the airlock. He goes to her.
116.

INT. AIRLOCK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist pulls off his respirator.
KAT: Where’s Neil?
PROTAGONIST: He must’ve already gone through...
KAT: I didn’t get to say goodbye – this
is goodbye, isn’t it?
PROTAGONIST: Today’s the 14th. Offshore of
Siberia – time for us to go. You
keep going back another day, give
you time to make it to Viet Nam.
KAT: Who gets me back on the yacht?
PROTAGONIST: I’ve got somebody good lined up.
I’d like to say you don’t have to
do this, but...
KAT: I once told you I didn’t need
redemption. But the chance to save
my child? You can’t know what that
means to a mother.
PROTAGONIST: No.
KAT: The worst thing Andrei ever did to
me was that offer – to let me go if
I never saw my son again. I
shouted, swore –
INSERT CUT: Kat FLINGS a crystal BOWL OF RASPBERRIES,
SMASHING it on a wooden deck...
KAT (CONT'D): But he’d seen it on my face – just
for an instant.
Kat looks at the Protagonist. Who says nothing.
KAT (CONT'D): I don’t know if I hate him more for
the things he’s done, or because he
knows that about me. You’ve killed
people you hated before?
117.
PROTAGONIST: It’s not usually personal.
KAT: He’s dying, anyway. It might not
even count –
PROTAGONIST: It always counts. You’re not there
to kill him – you’re the backstop.
If we haven’t lifted that algorithm
and he kills himself, he takes us
all with him, instantly.
Kat moves to the Protagonist, in close –
KAT: Just keep up your end, okay?
The Protagonist nods. She kisses him.
PROTAGONIST: When it’s over, and you’re raising
your boy. Carry this –
The Protagonist hands her a DUMB PHONE.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): There may be a time and place you
feel threatened. Hit talk, state
your location, hang up.
KAT: Who gets the message?
PROTAGONIST: Posterity.

INT./EXT. CHINOOK – LATER

The Protagonist watches the icebreaker recede...

EXT. VAST BARREN PLAIN, DUSTED WITH SNOW – DAY

Three CHINOOKS zoom low across the barren landscape, followed
by another three CHINOOKS long-lining SHIPPING CONTAINERS...

INT. CHINOOK – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist sits amongst a DOZEN SOLDIERS. They watch the
endless northern plain unroll beneath them...
118.

EXT. TENET CAMP – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist gets off the Chinook, watching another
Chinook gently set down a container. He follows the others to
a tent.

INT. BRIEFING TENT – CONTINUOUS

Soldiers in folding chairs facing a screen. The Protagonist
looks around – still no Neil. Ives steps up, signals for the
projector: a devastated CITY, grey CONCRETE and ABANDONED
industry amongst terraced strip mines...
IVES: Stalsk-12. Hidden from the world. A
city where anything can happen, and
today, gentlemen, for ten minutes,
it most assuredly does.
Ives switches to a GRAPHIC: a childishly simple diagram of a
LANDING AREA, BUILDINGS, then an UNDERGROUND CAVERN...
IVES (CONT'D): You were divided into two teams for
a temporal pincer movement. We
are Red team, moving forwards. Our
friends out there –
(gestures at containers)
– Blue team, led by Commander
Wheeler, are inverted. One hour
from now, they had this briefing...
INSERT CUT: Neil, in RESPIRATOR, in the front row of
Commander Wheeler’s briefing of BLUE TEAM. All are in
respirators...
BACK TO RED-TEAM BRIEFING –
IVES (CONT'D): Then were dropped on the ridge
above the hypocentre as close in
time to the detonation as possible.
Their objectives were clearance and
clarification. This briefing has
the benefit of their experience –
and yes, some of you specialists
are on both teams.
The Protagonist overhears –
RED SOLDIER 1: Why don’t they let us see them?
RED SOLDIER 2: Maybe we won’t like what happened.
119.

EXT. COAST OF VIET NAM – DAY

A SPEEDBOAT bounces through the chop, Mahir (from the
freeport heist) at the helm. Kat, beside him, shields her
eyes from the glare as they head towards Sator’s yacht. They
pull up some way off. A chopper sits on the yacht.
Mahir hands Kat binoculars – Kat watches her EARLIER SELF and
HER SON board the tender and head for shore...

INT. BRIEFING TENT – DAY

Ives gestures across the whole area on the schematic –
IVES: The entire area is radioactive, so
both teams wear full protection. To
distinguish teams, wear these –
A soldier starts passing out RED ARMBANDS...
INSERT CUT: Neil, in respirator, takes a BLUE ARMBAND, and,
like the rest of the team, puts it on...
BACK TO RED-TEAM BRIEFING –
Ives points to each of the three elements in turn:
IVES (CONT'D): Landing zone, LZ, well defended,
including ground-to-air ordinance.
We drop in, clear the LZ for Blue
team’s evacuation... We make our
way into the city proper... these
buildings are abandoned, but we
learned they have a turnstile in
this one... so expect a bi-temporal
response.
RED SOLDIER 1: They’ll have inverse ordinance?
IVES: Inverse, conventional, forwards
antagonists, inverted antagonists –
they have it all, and it can all
end you. Got it?
Ives goes back to the diagram –
IVES (CONT'D): On the other side of the city, the
ground rises to the ridge above the
hypocentre.
(MORE): 120.
Most of you will proceed up the
hill – a splinter unit will take a
tunnel from the city to the floor
of the hypocentre. Blue team
located an entrance here –
Ives points to the city’s edge. Then to the CAVERN.
IVES (CONT'D): The bomb is in the rock high above
to trigger a collapse, sealing the
cavern.
RED SOLDIER 2: How do we defuse the bomb up there?
IVES: We don’t. The explosion takes place
as planned, exactly ten minutes
after our landing. Everything is
synchronized to that explosion.
Both teams have countdown watches –
ours counts down from ten at
landing, to zero at the explosion.
He holds up his wrist to display a BLOOD-RED ‘10’ –
IVES (CONT'D): Blue team is the reverse –
INSERT CUT: a PREVIOUS BRIEFING (BLUE TEAM). NEIL watches as
Wheeler holds up her wrist to show a VIVID-BLUE ‘10’ –
WHEELER: Ten at the explosion, to zero at
our extraction. If you are not at
the LZ by zero, you are not
leaving.
BACK TO RED-TEAM BRIEFING –
IVES: Our job is to fail to defuse the
bomb, while the splinter unit
achieves its task undetected.
RED SOLDIER 1: Which is?
IVES: Need to know. And you don’t. Any
other stupid questions? Right,
let’s get ready.
Everybody RISES. The Protagonist approaches Ives.
PROTAGONIST: I wanted to be on the first wave.
IVES (CONT'D): 121.
IVES: There is no first wave – Red team
and Blue team operate
simultaneously. Do not get on the
chopper if you can’t stop thinking
in linear terms. You want to be on
the team who lifts the contents of
that capsule?
PROTAGONIST: Absolutely.
IVES: That’s us. We’re the splinter unit.
PROTAGONIST: Just us?
IVES: No one who knows the contents of
that capsule can leave the field. I
thought we’d manage ourselves.

EXT. COAST OF VIET NAM – DAY

Mahir shows Kat how to use a small pistol. Kat wears a two-
piece bathing suit with a shirt over. He puts the pistol in a
diver’s bag, loops the lanyard round Kat’s bare ankle.
MAHIR: It’s forty feet from the private
deck to the water. Can you jump it?
KAT: I can dive it.
They hear the chopper SPIN UP. Mahir shows her a FLARE GUN –
MAHIR: Until you see my signal, you don’t
let him die.
Kat nods. The chopper lifts off and ZOOMS overhead. Mahir
guns the powerboat, STREAKING towards the yacht...

EXT. TENET CAMP – DAY

The Soldiers head for the Chinooks. As they pass the
containers, some stare at them... the Chinooks lift off, some
Chinooks rise, LIFTING the containers...

EXT. COAST OF VIET NAM – DAY

Mahir pulls up fifty yards from the stern of Sator’s yacht...
Kat grabs the pistol bag and slips into the water...
122.

INT./EXT. NORTHERN PLAIN – DAY

The Chinooks BEAT LOW over the windswept plain. Stalsk-12
appears on the horizon – terraced strip-mined land leading to
a set of CONCRETESTRUCTURES FUSED TO THE EARTH...

EXT. SATOR’S YACHT, COAST OF VIET NAM – DAY

Kat quietly pulls herself out of the water and onto a rear
platform. She STEALTHILY makes her way up through the boat...

EXT. LZ, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The Chinooks long-lining containers RISE, slowing, as the
other Chinooks BARREL in towards a large flat area – ANTI-
AIRCRAFT GUNS start FIRING...
The Protagonist grabs his gun and LEAPS from the Chinook as
it hovers close to the ground...

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Chinooks long-lining containers fly BACKWARDS towards a
giant DEPRESSION...

INT. CONTAINER – CONTINUOUS

Neil looks out a peephole –
WHEELER: We’re coming in on the shock
wave... hang on, people! –
Neil GRABS his belts as WHUMMMMM!!!! The container SHUDDERS –

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The SHOCK WAVE CONTRACTS – the Chinook ‘SURFING’ backwards in
on the shock as it approaches the hypocentre... ENERGY
BUILDING... GROUND LIFTING AND FLATTENING...

EXT. LZ, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist joins a unit of Red team soldiers who CHARGE
an antiaircraft emplacement TAKING IT OUT BEFORE IT CAN FIRE
ON THE SLOW-MOVING CHINOOKS...
The Protagonist uses his assault rifle to take out a
gunemplacement. Ives uses an inverse grenade to violently
‘reassemble’ an enemy gun emplacement out of existence,
shredding the enemy with reverse shrapnel...
123.
IVES: Draw them back into the city, away
from Blue team...
The Chinooks drop down, land the containers – the Protagonist
looks back to see, a hundred metres away, the containers OPEN
– Blue team ‘SCRAMBLING’ BACKWARDS from the containers...
SOME CARRY INJURED COMRADES, ALL SEEM EXHAUSTED...
The Protagonist and Red team press forward, blasting at the
remaining enemy troops who run for the cover of the city...
the Protagonist checks his watch – a BRIGHT-RED ‘9:59’,
‘9:58’...

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – DAY

The reverse explosion PEAKS. SUDDEN CALM as the Chinooks
place the containers down – they open and Blue team runs out,
‘FORWARDS’, Neil at
the head, guns raised, BLASTING at the ENEMY SOLDIERS on the
ridge... Neil checks his watch – a BRIGHT-BLUE ‘9:57’,
‘9:56’... he turns to see a GREY TRUCK ‘REVERSING’ towards
the hole, tyres sucking up dust... a rope from its rear hitch
TAUT into the hole...
BANG! BANG! SHOTS are sucked out of the ground around him –
Blue team FORCES the enemy away from the hole, towards Red
team (whose members fight ‘backwards’) – Neil shouts to
Wheeler –
NEIL: Draw their fire! Pull them away...
He RACES down the ridge, following Wheeler...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

Kat comes out to find a JUNIOR CREW MEMBER cleaning up a
SMASHED BOWL OF RASPBERRIES. He looks up at her, surprised.
JUNIOR CREW MEMBER: Ma’am? We thought you’d gone
ashore.
KAT: I snuck back to surprise Andrei.
JUNIOR CREW MEMBER: The Boss left...
He trails off – they hear an INCOMING CHOPPER.
124.
KAT: I’ll get the mess. Have Mr Sator
find me here. Don’t tell the
others.
The Junior Crew Member nods, leaves – Kat moves to the RAIL,
checks Mahir in the distance, the DAYBED, the water HOSE...

EXT. LZ, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist, Ives and Red team head towards the large
concrete turnstile building on the outskirts of the city –
The Protagonist sees Wheeler running backwards towards a
BUNKER on their right which UNEXPLODES –
– GUNFIRE CRACKLES around them, pinning them down...
They hit the bunker with an RPG, then race around the left of
the turnstile building...

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – DAY

Wheeler leads Blue team down the hill – ‘chasing’ the enemy
who run BACKWARDS – a BLUE TEAM member TRIGGERS A LANDMINE –
another triggers an INVERSE LANDMINE –
WHEELER: Hit the deck! Mines!
As Blue team goes to the ground, Neil sees mines start to
EXPLODE/IMPLODE in a wave towards him as the GREY TRUCK RACES
BACKWARDS down the hill through the minefield, REVERSE-
TRIGGERING THE MINES – Neil DIVES out of the way, almost run
over...
Then gets up to follow the ‘path’ of the grey truck...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – LATE AFTERNOON

Kat unzips the diver’s bag, feels the handle of the gun, then
slides the bag under the daybed, checking she can reach. She
moves to the rail, crouches to UNCLIP the bottom safety
cable. She looks at Mahir’s boat across the water...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Ives leads Red team into the deserted concrete structures via
an efficient cover-and-move formation... the Protagonist
shelters behind LARGE CONCRETE CHUNKS. Which VIBRATE...
GATHERING ENERGY...: 125.
The Protagonist JUMPS AWAY as the chunks RIP FROM THE GROUND,
BOUNCING VIOLENTLY, DUSTILY OFF EACH OTHER AND FLYING UP INTO
A GAP IN THE SIDE OF A BUILDING as an INVERSE RPG ZIPS back
up into a WINDOW –
Ives has spotted the window and calls for an RPG to ‘follow’
the inverse one, BLASTING the building... the Protagonist
checks his watch – ‘8:10’, ‘8:09’...

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – DAY

Neil checks his watch – ‘8:08’, ‘8:07’... he heads downhill,
towards the city, where the rest of Blue team BEAT BACK the
enemy...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – LATE AFTERNOON

Kat hoses the raspberries and glass from the deck... Sator
appears, watching as she turns the water on herself.
SATOR: They told me you’d gone ashore.
KAT: They told me you’d flown off.
SATOR: I came back. To see you and Max.
KAT: Max is on shore with Anna. We need
time, just you and me. After what -
SATOR: I was joking. A stupid joke –
KAT: You think I’m a terrible mother.
SATOR: We both know my opinion of you is
higher than yours of me.
KAT: I want things to be better, Andrei.
She moves towards him. Sator nods. Picks up the phone –
SATOR: Have the captain turn the boat so
we’ll see the sunset from here.
126.

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist RUNS across the street, FIRING at the
enemy... he SPOTS the TUNNEL ENTRANCE between two buildings.
PROTAGONIST: Ives! Splinter unit here!
Ives nods. RACES over, drawing fire the whole way...

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12

Neil races into the city streets... he sees Commander Wheeler
and a BLUE SOLDIER take shelter in a large jagged BREACH in
the ground-floor wall of a massive structure.
Neil is FORCED to hit the deck, ducking INVERTED fire all
around... he looks over at Wheeler, and sees DUST GATHERING
AROUND THE BREACH...:
NEIL: Wheeler! Get out of there! Wheeler!
Wheeler hears him – tries to grab the Blue Soldier – MASSIVE
CHUNKS OF CONCRETE SCRAPE OVER NEIL’S HEAD, FLYING TOWARDS
WHEELER, who DIVES CLEAR – the wall REASSEMBLES ON TOP OF the
Blue Soldier, CRUSHING HIM...
Neil winces. Starts crawling for better cover... checks his
watch – ‘6:24’,‘6:23’...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – LATE AFTERNOON

Sator looks past Kat to the lowering sun.
SATOR: It’s going to be a beautiful
sunset. I’ll get Max brought back –
we should share the moment with
him.
Sator picks up the phone. Kat looks at the shore, uneasy...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Ives and the Protagonist shelter as Red team exchanges fire
with the Enemy further up the street. The Protagonist checks
his watch – ‘5:15’, ‘5:14’...
PROTAGONIST: Let’s go. We’re running out of
time.
127.
IVES: If they see us, it’s all for
nothing.
PROTAGONIST: We need a distraction.
Ives looks ahead to the LEANING RUIN OF A BUILDING TOP...
IVES: Don’t worry about that...

EXT. CITY STREETS – DAY

Neil checks his watch – ‘5:10’, ‘5:09’... frustrated, pinned
down, he looks around for a way to break cover...
Commander Wheeler, with the rest of Blue team, SHELTERS in
the shadow of the RUINED BASE of a building, pinned by ENEMY
FIRE from the base of the building...
WHEELER: RPG! Take out the base – on my mark
–
She checks her watch – ‘5:04’, ‘5:03’...
The BLUE RPG SOLDIER takes aim...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist spots SMALL DEBRIS ROLLING across the
street... GATHERING MOMENTUM...
PROTAGONIST: Ives!
Ives sees LARGER and LARGER debris is ROLLING down the street
towards the LEANING RUIN OF A BUILDING TOP...
IVES: It’s about to get distracting...
He signals a RED RPG SOLDIER...
IVES (CONT'D): On my mark!
He looks at his watch – ‘5:01’, ‘5:00’ –
IVES (CONT'D): Fire!
The leaning ruin THRUSTS UPWARDS –
128.

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Wheeler watches as the Leaning Ruin’s UPPER STOREYS
REASSEMBLE, as its BASE EXPLODES...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist takes cover as the Leaning Ruin’s BASE
REASSEMBLES as its UPPER STOREYS EXPLODE... the Protagonist
and Ives race at the tunnel entrance – the GREY TRUCK RACES
at them as they dive for the tunnel...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Wheeler ducks as the weight of the upper storeys COLLAPSES
the building...
Neil lifts his head after the EXPLO/IMPLOSION. Clear. He gets
up and starts RUNNING...

EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist and Ives RACE into the tunnel, HITTING A
TRIPWIRE WHICH BLOWS THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE DOWN BEHIND THEM AS
THEY JUMP INSIDE...:

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – LATE AFTERNOON

Sator hangs up. He holds a SILVER PILL in the sunlight,
studying it...
KAT: What’s that?
SATOR: I borrowed it from the CIA.
KAT: But what is it?
SATOR: The way the world ends, not with a
bang but a whimper.
KAT: I don’t understand.
SATOR: When I take this, it’s all over.
KAT: Then don’t take it, yet.
Sator looks at her, needing her to care.
129.
SATOR: Why not?
KAT: We’ve got the sunset coming and a
little vodka left...
SATOR: And Max will be here soon... they
thought it was you, not Anna, on
shore with Max.
Kat steps up in front of Sator, seductive...
KAT: As long as you can tell the
difference...
Sator smiles appreciatively, but pulls out his phone –
SATOR: A moment’s business, my love...

EXT. MAHIR’S BOAT – CONTINUOUS

Mahir checks his radio –
IVES: (over radio)
Not clear. Repeat, not clear...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist and Ives look back at the COLLAPSED ENTRANCE
–
PROTAGONIST: We’re committed now.
They turn and RACE through the mining tunnel...
IVES: (into radio)
Just hold tight – we’re almost
there...

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Neil spots SATOR’S GREY MI8 OVERHEAD, a rope hanging down.
Across the street he sees VOLKOV REVERSE-EXIT the tunnel
mouth, CROUCHING to ‘DERIG’ a tripwired booby trap, carrying
it towards the chopper, then LEAPING up onto the line –
RISING from the streets...
130.
Neil STARES. CONCERNED. Checks his watch – ‘4:10’, ‘4:09’...
Then TAKES OFF, SPRINTING –
WHEELER: Neil!
She watches him go ahead, then signals Blue team to keep
pushing forward...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist and Ives run down the tunnel... they slow as
they see a BODY, blue armband, lying on the ground on the
opposite side of a SET OF BARS at the end of the tunnel.
They can see into the hypocentre, the GIANT ATOMIC-HEWN
CAVERN, daylight above, CAPSULE on the rock floor next to the
mouth of a BORE HOLE. The Protagonist checks his watch –
‘4:06’, ‘4:05’ ... Ives checks the ELECTRONIC LOCK –
IVES: We don’t have anything big enough
to blow this. Try him –
The Protagonist reaches through the bars and checks the body
– FREEZES: attached to a zip, a TALISMAN – A COIN WITH A HOLE
HANGING FROM A SMALL LENGTH OF ORANGE AND YELLOW STRING...
The Protagonist looks at it, quizzical, rises –
PROTAGONIST: Nothing. Can you pick it?
SATOR (O.S.): I hope not. I paid a lot for that
lock...
WHAM! Ives goes down – SHOT BY VOLKOV, bullet SPARKING off
his helmet – on the other side of the bars – gun pointed at
the Protagonist, FIELD RADIO held out... Sator’s voice ECHOES
through the tunnel –
SATOR (CONT'D): (over phone)
How do you like where my journey
began, and yours ends?
Volkov takes the Protagonist’s gun. Forces him to push Ives’s
gun through the bars.
PROTAGONIST: A little radioactive for my taste.
Volkov drops the guns into the water, places the radio by the
bars...
131.

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – LATE AFTERNOON

Sator steps away from Kat as he speaks quietly into the
phone.
SATOR: My fate was always bound up with
radiation. We’d work where no one
else would. We made a devil’s
bargain – money for time. We sold
our futures.
Kat looks at Mahir’s boat. Nothing. She looks to the shore.
Far in the distance, she can see the TENDER APPROACHING...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist looks at Volkov. At the bars between him and
the capsule...
PROTAGONIST: Now you’re making the same mistake
for the entire world.
SATOR: (over phone)
It wasn’t a mistake. I made the
bargain I could. What was yours?
You fight for a cause you barely
understand. With people you trust
so little you’ve told them nothing
about what you’re doing. When I die
the world dies with me. And your
knowledge dies with you. Buried in
the tomb like an anonymous Egyptian
builder sealed in the pyramid to
keep his secret...

INT. TURNSTILE BUILDING, STALSK-12 – DAY

Neil comes into the turnstile room... he watches ENEMY TROOPS
enter/exit the machine, inverting to join the battle. He
waits for his chance... the room is empty... he sees himself
through the proving window, and RUNS at the machine...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – EVENING

Sator speaks into his phone –
SATOR: Your faith is blind. You’re a
fanatic.
132.
PROTAGONIST: (over phone)
What’s more fanatical than trying
to destroy the world?
Kat moves towards Sator, but he raises a finger...
SATOR: I’m not. I’m creating a new one.
Somewhere, sometime, a man in a
crystalline tower throws a switch
and Armageddon is both triggered
and avoided. Entropy inverts the
same way the magnetic poles have
switched 183 times over the
millennia. Now time itself switches
direction.
Sator looks out at the lowering sun...
SATOR (CONT'D): The same sunshine we’ve basked in
will warm the faces of our
descendants generations from now.
Kat looks at Mahir’s boat. Nothing. She looks to shore,
watching the TENDER APPROACHING...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist looks at his watch – ‘2:12’, ‘2:11’...
PROTAGONIST: How can they want to destroy us?
SATOR: (over phone)
Because their oceans rose and their
rivers ran dry. Don’t you see –?
Their world shrivelled because of
us. They have no choice but to turn
back, there’s no life ahead of
them. And we’re responsible.
Knowing this, do you still want me
to stop?
PROTAGONIST: Yes. Each generation looks out for
its own survival.

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

Sator looks out at the glittering water –
SATOR: That’s exactly what they’re doing.
133.
PROTAGONIST: (over phone)
Sure, but not you. You’re a
traitor. Bringing death to all
because you have no life of your
own left.
SATOR: When I’m done, life continues.
PROTAGONIST: (over phone)
Not your son’s.
SATOR: My greatest sin was to bring a son
into a world I knew was ending...
do you think God will forgive me?
PROTAGONIST: (over phone)
For killing your son? No.
SATOR: He should understand – he killed
his own.

EXT. CITY STREETS, STALSK-12 – DAY

Neil, FORWARDS NOW, spots a GREY TRUCK outside the turnstile
building – he jumps in, FIRING IT UP –
RACING THROUGH THE STREETS, PAST THE IMPLODING/ EXPLODING
BUILDING, racing for the tunnel mouth, trying to head off the
Protagonist and Ives –
NEIL: Wait! Wait!
They dive into the tunnel, which COLLAPSES. Neil sets his
sights on the hypocentre ridge above, GUNS the engine...

EXT. LZ, STALSK-12 – DAY

Wheeler leads Blue team towards the CHINOOKS LOWERING
CONTAINERS... as they carry their wounded and lurch towards
the containers, they see Red team ‘REASSEMBLING’ the anti-
aircraft guns...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist watches Volkov pick up a BLACK, METAL,
GEOMETRICALLY COMPLEX BAR... the algorithm.
134.
PROTAGONIST: You don’t believe in God. Or a new
future. Or anything outside your
own experience.
SATOR: (over phone)
That’s all any of us knows. The
rest is belief, and I don’t have
it.
PROTAGONIST: Without it you’re not human. You’re
a madman.
SATOR: (over phone)
Or a god of sorts.
PROTAGONIST: Like I said.
Volkov slowly backs towards the capsule with the algorithm...
The Protagonist looks down at Ives – whose hand is MOVING...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

A BEEP. Sator checks his watch.
SATOR: Our time is up.
He looks across at Kat standing by the rail.
SATOR (CONT'D): I’ll give my wife your love.
PROTAGONIST: (over phone)
You’re forgetting, I haven’t met
her, yet.
SATOR: That’s right, after you meet her,
she dies. I’ll just give her my
love, instead.

INT. HYPOCENTRE, STALSK-12 – DAY

Volkov seals the capsule – hooks it to a winch... the
Protagonist watches Ives’s hand emerge with a SIDEARM...
Volkov raises the capsule up over the mouth of the DEEP BORE
HOLE, then steps back, preparing to release the winch and
drop the capsule into the well...
135.

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – SUNSET

Sator goes to hang up, pauses... an afterthought –
SATOR: Volkov?

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

Volkov RUSHES FORWARD with his gun...
SATOR: (over phone; in Russian,
subtitled)
– Shoot him in the head. –
Volkov PULLS HIS TRIGGER – but the Dead Tenet Soldier has
‘RISEN’ to be in front of the gun ‘ABSORBING’ the bullet –
then LEAPING to one side, ALIVE –

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS

Sator hears the shot, SATISFIED – Kat pulls the phone away –
KAT: Enough business, Andrei...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist DIVES to where Ives is lying, GRABS his gun –
Volkov TURNS, RUNNING FOR the winch-release –
PROTAGONIST:
WAIT! WAIT!: He FIRES at Volkov, who goes down just short of the winch...
Ives struggles to his feet, checking his watch – ‘1:07’,
‘1:06’...
Hearing BEEPS, Ives looks up. THE LOCK is open –

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

Neil RACES up the slope to the ridge – through the MINEFIELD,
setting off personnel mines in his wake, NARROWLY AVOIDING
RUNNING HIMSELF OVER...:

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – EVENING

As Kat pours him a drink, Sator looks out at the glowing
horizon, fiddling with the silver pill... he POINTS –
136.
SATOR: Tomorrow the sun will rise in that
same spot. For the first time in
history. Because I’ve told it to.
(looks at her like she’s
a loyal dog)
You have no idea what I’m talking
about, do you?
She looks at him, smiles sweetly.
KAT: It sounds terribly important,
Andrei.
He reaches for her – she gets up, moves to the rail –
SATOR: Where’re you going?
She grabs the hose, starts spraying herself –
KAT: Aren’t you hot?
Kat sprays the deck in front of the rail –
SATOR: What’re you doing, now?
KAT: I spilled sunscreen.
SATOR: So what?
KAT: It’s slippery.
SATOR: Just come here...
She looks at Sator lying on the daybed like an appalling
emperor. Moves towards him. Grabs the sunscreen.
KAT: Turn over.
SATOR: The sun’s almost gone.
KAT: You’ll like it.
He rolls over, obedient. She squirts a large dollop across
his back. Looks up at Mahir’s boat, hopeful. Nothing.
137.
She checks her watch as she lazily smears the sunscreen
across Sator’s back. He groans. Kat watches the TENDER
APPROACHING, she can just make out HERSELF AND HER SON...

INT. TUNNEL, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist watches the Dead Tenet Soldier RACING
BACKWARDS from the gate, out of the tunnel –
IVES:
COME ON!: The Protagonist TURNS – Ives swings the gate open – they RACE
through, just before it closes, SLAMMING SHUT behind them –
IVES (CONT'D): Tunnel’s sealed!
The Protagonist steps over Volkov, STRUGGLES with the
capsule, it swings, HANGING precariously over the well...
IVES (CONT'D): (into radio)
Mahir, do you copy?

EXT. MAHIR’S BOAT – EVENING

Mahir looks through binoculars, FRUSTRATED, flare gun ready –
IVES: (over radio)
Hold! Repeat, hold!

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – DAY

Neil REVERSES towards the hole – jumps out, pulling a line
from the rear winch...

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – SUNSET

Kat looks at Mahir’s boat. Nothing. She checks her watch...
looks down at the tender approaching – it’s close enough she
can clearly see HERSELF CHATTING AND LAUGHING WITH MAX... she
jumps up from the daybed, holding the diver’s bag. Sator
looks up at her, surprised.
KAT: I can’t do this.
SATOR: Don’t spoil this moment, Kat.
KAT: I can’t let you think you’ve won...
138.
Sator looks at her, suddenly wary...
SATOR: What are you talking about,
Katherine?
KAT: I’m not letting you go to your
grave thinking we’re all coming
with you. I can’t give you that –
She pulls out the SILENCED PISTOL. He is UTTERLY UNAFRAID.
KAT (CONT'D): You’re dying alone, Andrei.
SATOR: (contemptuous)
No, I’m not.
KAT: Andrei, look in my eyes. Which do
you see, despair... or anger?
SATOR: What?
KAT: I’m not the woman who could find
love for you even though you’d
scarred her on the inside...
Kat pulls up her shirt to reveal the MASSIVE, ANGRY SCAR –
KAT (CONT'D): I’m the vengeful bitch you scarred
on the outside.
Sator realizes he’s been conned – LUNGES FOR HER –
SATOR: You –!
KAT SHOOTS HIM IN THE UPPER CHEST – his hands go to his chest
– he GASPS, air leaking from his lungs... Kat ROLLS Sator off
the daybed onto his back – he GURGLES – she GRABS his legs –
SLIDES HIM AT THE GAP BELOW THE RAIL –
Sator SHOOTS off the deck, TUMBLING DOWN to the sea – his
head CRACKS on the rear platform as he HITS the water –

EXT. MAHIR’S BOAT – CONTINUOUS

Mahir lowers his binoculars, STARTLED, as he sees Sator’s
body pitch into the sea –
139.
MAHIR: (into radio)
She’s killed him! She’s killed him!
Mahir GUNS the engine, racing towards the yacht...

INT. HYPOCENTRE, STALSK-12 – DAY

The Protagonist opens the capsule, revealing the algorithm –
IVES: She jumped the gun – she killed
him!
The Protagonist looks at Ives, ashen – A LINE DROPS BETWEEN
THEM –:

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

Neil is at the wheel of the truck. Through the rear-view
mirror he looks at his line running into the hole. Through
the windshield he watches Red and Blue soldiers finish
loading and LIFT OFF. He checks his watch – ‘00:09’,
‘00:08’...
NEIL: Fuck it –
He GUNS it, PULLING AWAY FROM THE HOLE –

INT. HYPOCENTRE, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist and Ives are YANKED into the air, the
Protagonist CLUTCHING the algorithm – as they approach the
rocky edge of the hole, Ives raises his boots to cushion the
– IMPACT! They BOUNCE PAINFULLY over the lip –

EXT. HYPOCENTRE RIDGE, STALSK-12 – CONTINUOUS

The truck DRAGS them along the rocky ground, away from the
hole as... BOOOOM!!!! THE ROCKY GROUND BUCKLES WITH FORCE –
SMOKE and FLAMES BLAST up out of the hole in an ANGRY PLUME –
The ground around the hole COLLAPSES IN AN EVER-GROWING
RADIUS –: The line SNAPS, leaving the Protagonist and Ives TUMBLING to
a stop... The SUBSIDENCE approaches, SLOWING, SLOWING... the
ground OPENS UP under the Protagonist – Ives GRABS HIM – the
Protagonist has the algorithm in his hands, Ives PULLS him
back onto solid ground...
140.

EXT. LZ, STALSK-12 – DAY

Wheeler PULLS a last Blue team soldier into the container as
her watch hits ZERO – the container door SLAMS shut –
BLUE TEAM SOLDIER: Do you think they made it?

EXT. PRIVATE DECK, SATOR’S YACHT – SUNSET

Kat picks up the shell casing, drops it in the diver’s bag,
zips it up, attaches the lanyard to her ankle, sprays down
the deck, WASHING away BLOOD and SUNSCREEN...
Kat steps up to the railing. Watches Mahir, down below,
getting a line on Sator’s body. Kat glances over at the
TENDER ARRIVING WITH HER EARLIER SELF AND HER SON... Kat
DIVES, ARCING GRACEFULLY THROUGH THE SUNSET...
Kat’s earlier self, stepping onto the yacht, catches a
glimpse of a graceful form SLICING into the water. She looks,
CURIOUS, but Max TUGS her sleeve and she turns.

EXT. COAST OF VIET NAM – CONTINUOUS

On Mahir’s SPEEDING boat, Kat hands Mahir the diver’s bag and
looks up ahead to the last light of day...
PROTAGONIST: (over radio)
Kat, you jumped the gun!
Mahir hands her the radio –
KAT: I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t let
him die thinking he’d won. And I
knew you’d find a way.
Silence. She glances Mahir, suddenly concerned –
KAT (CONT'D): Wait, you found a way? We’re okay,
right?
PROTAGONIST: (over radio)
Yeah. We found a way. Be safe.
Mahir’s boat SPEEDS AWAY through the twilight...
...DRAGGING Sator’s body behind.
141.

EXT. WINDSWEPT PLAIN OUTSIDE STALSK-12 – EVENING

A Chinook swirls snow around the blasted ruins... Ives and
the Protagonist slump, bruised, exhausted, gas masks off,
breathing hard. On the ground between them – the matte-black
algorithm... Neil approaches, removing his gas mask...
PROTAGONIST: I thought you were inverted.
NEIL: Changed gears halfway – you needed
help here.
IVES: We needed help down there.
(to Protagonist)
How’d you get that lock open?
PROTAGONIST: It wasn’t me.
(to Neil)
Didn’t your team need you?
NEIL: I’ll get them on the next pass.
Right, Ives?
IVES: Once I’ve caught my breath.
The Protagonist reaches for the algorithm – Ives PULLS it out
of his reach – his gun laying casually across his leg. As
Neil and the Protagonist watch, Ives takes his weapon in
hand, gets to his feet... He lifts the algorithm... looks
around at the deserted plain above Stalsk-12...
IVES (CONT'D): Nice and private.
Ives SEPARATES the algorithm into THREE COMPONENTS –
PROTAGONIST: No one who’s seen this leaves the
field...
IVES: We hide it, we end our lives. It’s
the only way to be sure.
Ives TOSSES them each one component...
IVES (CONT'D): But as to when...
Ives HOLSTERS his sidearm.
142.
IVES (CONT'D): Maybe that’s every man’s decision
to make for himself.
NEIL: You’re not going to kill us?
IVES: If I ever find you I will.
NEIL: But you won’t look too hard.
IVES: Yes, I will.
Neil shakes his head, smiling at this. Ives heads towards the
Chinook. Neil and the Protagonist watch him go...
NEIL: You’re not heading back to London
to check on Kat, are you?
PROTAGONIST: Of course not. That would be too
dangerous.
NEIL: Even from afar.
PROTAGONIST: Even from afar.
Neil thinks of something. Looks at Ives –
NEIL: Ives, wait!
Neil takes his section of the algorithm, REATTACHES it to the
Protagonist’s.
PROTAGONIST: You’re really going back in?
NEIL: I’m the only one who could’ve got
that door open in time, right Ives?
Ives looks at Neil, sizing him up.
IVES: I don’t have any locksmiths as good
as you.
Neil turns to the Protagonist, grabs his BACKPACK...
143.
NEIL: See? That’s me in there, again.
Weaving another pass in the fabric
of this mission.
Neil SWINGS his pack onto his back, revealing a TALISMAN – A
COIN WITH A HOLE TIED to the zip WITH ORANGE AND YELLOW
THREAD –:
PROTAGONIST: Neil, wait.
NEIL: We just saved the world – we can’t
leave anything to chance.
The Protagonist thinks. Struggles.
PROTAGONIST: But can we change things? If we do
it differently...?
Neil looks back at the Protagonist. Sees his struggle...
NEIL: What’s happened’s happened.
(smiles)
Which is an expression of faith in
the mechanics of the world, not an
excuse to do nothing.
PROTAGONIST: Fate?
NEIL: Call it what you want.
PROTAGONIST: What do you call it?
NEIL: Reality. Now let me go.
The Protagonist lets him walk, tears welling up... CALLS OUT
–
PROTAGONIST: Hey!
(Neil turns)
You never did tell me who recruited
you.
NEIL: (smiles)
Haven’t you guessed by now? You
did. Just not when you thought. You
have a future in the past. Years
ago for me. Years from now for you.
144.
PROTAGONIST: You’ve known me for years?
NEIL: (nods)
For me, I think this is the end of
a beautiful friendship.
PROTAGONIST: But for me it’s just the beginning?
NEIL: And we get up to some stuff. You’re
gonna love it. You’ll see. This
whole operation is a temporal
pincer.
PROTAGONIST: Whose?
NEIL: Yours. You’re only halfway there.
I’ll see you at the beginning,
friend.
Neil turns. Follows Ives to board the Chinook. The
Protagonist watches him go...
NEIL (V.O.): We’re the people saving the world
from what might have been...
The Protagonist looks down at the algorithm in his hands.
NEIL (V.O.): The world will never know what
could’ve happened...
He pulls up his collar and walks into the snow...

EXT. SCHOOL GATES – AFTERNOON

Kat is walking up the road to the school gates.
NEIL (V.O.): ...and even if they did they
wouldn’t care...
She feels something wrong. Looking across the road, she sees
a car with tinted windows shadowing her.
NEIL (V.O.): ...because no one cares about the
bomb that didn’t go off...
She gets out the dumb phone the Protagonist had given her...
145.
NEIL (V.O.): ...just the one that did...

INT./EXT. CAR – CONTINUOUS

Priya is in the front passenger seat. The DRIVER next to her
has a GUN and SILENCER sitting on his knee...
PRIYA: Do it before the boy comes out.
The rear door opens – a dull thud – the Driver is SHOT by a
silenced pistol –
PROTAGONIST (O.S.): That’s your idea of mercy?
Priya turns – the Protagonist has a gun to the back of her
seat.
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D): You gave me your word.
PRIYA: And I told you what it would be
worth. Here. Today. How did you
know?
He holds up a dumb phone, plays a voicemail –
KAT: (via recording)
Cannon Place, 3 o’clock, it’s –
PROTAGONIST: Posterity.

EXT. SCHOOL GATES – CONTINUOUS

Kat hits send, speaks into the phone –
KAT: Cannon Place, 3 o’clock, it’s
probably nothing...

INT./EXT. CAR – CONTINUOUS

The Protagonist watches Kat.
PROTAGONIST: I told you you’d have to start
looking differently at the world.
PRIYA: I have to tie up the loose ends.
146.
PROTAGONIST: That was never your job.
PRIYA: Then whose was it?
The Protagonist brings his focus back to Priya.
PROTAGONIST: Mine. I realized I wasn’t working
for you. We’ve both been working
for me... I’m the protagonist.
PRIYA: Then you’d better tie up those
loose ends.
He shoots her through the seat back. She slumps forward.
PROTAGONIST: Mission accomplished.
The Protagonist looks across the road. The kids stream out...
Kat sees Max coming, takes one last look at the dark car...
NEIL (V.O.): ...but it’s the bomb that didn’t go
off...
Kat shakes her head, smiling at her own folly, looks at the
phone like it’s silly –
NEIL (V.O.): ...the danger no one knew was
real...
She tosses the phone carelessly into her bag.
NEIL (V.O.): That’s the bomb with the real power
to change the world.
The Protagonist watches Kat and Max walk away. Max offers Kat
his hand and we –
FADE OUT.:
CREDITS.:
END.: 147.
FADE IN:: TOP HATS.  Clustered in a small glade.  As we SUPER TITLES,
a BLACK CAT slinks its way through them.  As TITLES END-
BORDEN (V.O.): Are you watching closely?
A SECOND BLACK CAT races into frame, HISSING, SPITTING,
CHASING the first cat into the woods beyond and we-
CUT TO::

INT. CLUTTERED WORKSHOP -- DAY

Moving along a row of CANARIES in CAGES.
CUTTER (V.O.): Every magic trick consists of three
part, or acts...
Stop at a cage.  Weathered HANDS envelope the canary.  Hands
and voice belongs to a man in his 60's- CUTTER.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D): The first part is called the Pledge...
A LITTLE GIRL pershes on a chest in the workshop, watching.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D): ...the magician shows you something
ordinary-
Cutter moves to a small ORNATE CAGE resting on a prop table.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D): A deck of cards, ar a bird...

INT. SCALA THEATRE, LONDON -- NIGHT

A packed house. Many hands raised. Move in on a BEARDED MAN,
his gloved hand tentatively rising into the air.
CUTTER (V.O.): ...or a man.
A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Bearded Man from the aisle. He
shuffles along his row towards her. Embarrassed.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D): He show you this object, and pledges
to you its utter normality...
Bearbed Man and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant
down towards the stage...
2.
On which stands the magician, leaning on his cane, smiling.
This is ROBERT ANGIER, 35, an American. Looming over him is
a large and complex ELETRICAL MACHINE.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D): Perhaps he asks you to inspect it...
Bearbed Man, FASCINATED, and other Volunteers look over
the vast machine.  As angier GESTURES theatrically at the
various features of the metal and glass apparatus.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D): ...to see that it is indeed real...
As the Assistant leads the Volunteers off the stage, Bearded
Man slips through the gap at the side of the curtains-
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D): ...unaltered...

INT. STAGE THEATRE, BACKSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS

-looks around, DISORIENTED, then darts for some stairs leagind
below stage where he runs into a burly STAGEHAND.
CUTTER (V.O.): ...normal.
STAGEHAND: Where'd you think you're going?!
CUTTER (V.O.): But, of course, it probably isn't...
Bearded Man pulls off his beard, revealing the face of ALFRED
BORDEN, mid 30's.
BEARDED MAN: I'm part of the act, you fool!
The Stagehand raises his eyebrows and steps aside.  Borden
RACES down below the stage.  Cutter approaches the Stagehand.
CUTTER: Who was that?

INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS

As the machine GROANS to life. SPARKING and CRACKLING, Angier
gazes at it, forgettig his audience.   Entranced.  Possessed.

INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Borden fumbles through the darkned area, lit by flashes and
sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above.  He
GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE
EYES sitting nearby. Borden waves a hand in front of the
3.

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Cutter gently places the canary into the ornate cage.
CUTTER (V.O.): The second act is called the Turn...

INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT

Angier, facing the audience, steps into the machine.
CUTTER (V.O.): The magician takes the ordinary
something...

INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Borden lights a MATCH.  In front of him is a LARGE GLASS
TANK FILLED WITH WATER, ITs LID PROPPED OPEN.  Borden frowns.
CUTTER (V.O.): ...and makes it do something
extraordianry.

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Cutter places a SILK SHAWL over the cage. Then SLAMS his
hands down on the shawl, which FLATTENS- The Little Girl
FLINCHES.  Then STARES, FASCINATED.
CUTTER (V.O.): Now you're looking for the secret.

INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT

Bolts of electicity draw inwards, wrapping Angier in a ball
of light which CRACKS-
CUTTER (V.O.): But you won't find it...

INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

The ROOM fills with light as a TRAPDOOR snaps open and a
BODY DROPS INTO THE TANK.
CUTTER: Because of course, you're not really
looking...
The lid of the tank and trapdoor above SNAP SHUT, leaving
the tank, and Borden, in complete DARKNESS.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D): ...you don't really want to know.
4.

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Cutter WHIPS the shawl from the table.  Cage and bird have
DISAPPEARED.:
CUTTER (V.O.): ...you want to be fooled.
The Little Girl stares, EXPECTANT.
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D): But you couldn't clap yet. Because
making something disappear isn't
enough... you have to bring it back.

INT. SCALA THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS

The MACHINE sputters to a stop.  Angier is GONE.  The audience
sits, WAITING.
CUTTER (V.O.): That's why every magic trick has a
third act.  The hardest part..,

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Cutter forms a fist.  Drapes the shawl over it.
CUTTER (V.O.): ...the part we call...
Cutter WHIPS  the shawl away to reveal- the CANARY.  The
Little Girl CLAPS.

INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- NIGHT

Borden LIGHTS another match.  Stares in HORROR-
CUTTER (V.O.): ...The Prestige.
Inside the tank, ANGIER IS DROWNING. His rolling EYES fixes
on BORDEN, he POUNDS desperately on the thick glass, SCREAMING
BUBBLES... The screen fades to BLACK.
PROSECUTOR (V.O.): The Prestige...?

INT. COURTROOM -- DAY

The PROSECUTOR turns to face the witness in the box: Cutter.
PROSECUTOR: And did Robert Angier, the Great
Danton, your employer, get to that
final part of his trick that night?
5.
CUTTER: No, sir. Something went wrong.
PROSECUTOR: What went wrong?
CUTTER: I saw a someone head below the
stage... I followed... and I found
Borden-
Cutter points at the dock: Borden is there, CHAINED TO THE
FLOOR. FLANKED BY GUARDS. Cutter POINTS.
CUTTER (CONT'D): -watching Mr. Angier drown in a tank.
PROSECUTOR: Would you describe your occupation
to the jury please, Mr.Cutter?
CUTTER: I'm an ingeneur. I design illusions
and construct the apparatus necessary
for perfoming them.
PROSECUTOR: And for how long had you been
Mr.Angier's "ingeneur"?
CUTTER: Eight years.  I was privvy to the
secrets of his entire act.
PROSECUTOR: So, Mr.Cutter, was this water-filled
tank beneath the stage part of
Mr.Angier's illusion- the illusion
billed as "THE REAL TRANSPORTED MAN"?
CUTTER: No, sir. The tank had been used for
the first trick, then taken offstage.
Borden must have put it under the
trap door after the interval.
Cutter looks across at Borden, who is absently tapping his
hand against the rail- it is MUTILATED, MISSING 2 1/2 FINGERS.
The DEFENDER STANDS.
DEFENDER: How large was this tank?
CUTTER: The sort of tank used for underwater
escapes- four or five hundred gallons.
6.
DEFENDER: How do you think Mr.Borden was able
to move the tank under the trap door
without anyone noticing?
CUTTER: Ask him- he's the magician.
Titters from the gallery.  The Defenser turns to the JUDGE.
DEFENDER: (impatient)
I ask again that this man explain
the mechanics of Mr.Angier's illusion.
CUTTER: (angry)
If I reveal my magician's secrets
here in open court, I'll be
unemployable and the secrets will be
worthless.  The Real Transported Man
is the most sought-after illusion in
the business and I have te right to
sell it on.
The Judge considers this.  He looks at Cutter.  Sympathetic.
JUDGE: Mr.Cutter, I see your predicament
but we are talking about a capital
offence- Alfred Borden's life hangs
in the balance.
Cutter looks down.  Quiet.
JUDGE (CONT'D): If you were prepared to disclose the
details to me in private, I might be
able to judge their relevance to the
case.
(addresses lawyers)
Might this be an acceptable
compromisse?
Amid murmurs of  assent, the Judge ADJOURNS the proceedings.
As the Guards begin the complex ritual of unlocking Borden's
chainsa from the floor, Borden's looks across the courtroom: The LITTLE GIRL from the opening stands in the gallery,
looking back at him.  Borden gives her a little WAVE.  She
waves back, then is GUIDED OUT by a man wearing GLOVES and
BOWLER HAT- this is FALLON.  He nods at Borden.
7.

EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY

OWENS, 50's a lawyer, stands at the entry gate. The CAPTAIN
of the guard walks out to greet him.
CAPTAIN: I'm going to have to ask you to turn
out your pockets.
Owens raises his eyebrows.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D): Not my idea, sir.  The Warden saw
his show in Manchester last year
where he vanished into thin air-
he's convinced he'll try an escape.
Owens smiles as he hands over his pocket watch ans wallet.
They walk along a hall wrought iron fence.  The PRISON looms
over them.
A door in the prison opens and Borden emerges, trussed
absurdly in chains held by two WARDERS.  The other INMATES
begin cattle-calling and whistling as BOrden is paraded up
to a WOODEN SECTION of the fence.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D): I told him the only way Borden's
going to disappear is if I leave him
out with the others immates.
At the fence, the Warders lock the ends of their chains to a
thick eye hook set into the ground.
CAPTAIN (CONT'D): (to warders)
Check the locks.  Twice.
They check the locks.  Then retreat to allow privacy.  The
Captain marches away.  Borden looks at Owens.  Bored.
OWENS: My name is Owens- I'm a solicitor.
Borden says nothing.
OWENS (CONT'D): I represent Lord Caldlow, and
accomplished amateur magician and
historian of magic-
BORDEN: How much?
OWENS: Lord Caldlow is interested in-
8.
BORDEN: (cold)
How much for my tricks?
OWENS: Five thousand pounds.
BORDEN: Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer- the
money's for him.
OWENS: I did.  He offered to sell all of
your tricks... except the most
valuable one - The Transported Man.
BORDEN: I'd never forgive myself for selling
my greatest trick.
Borden signals the Wardens to come and unlock him.
OWENS: Even for your daughter?
Borden looks up.  Owens moves closer, quietly assertive.
OWENS (CONT'D): If the newspapers are right, and
you're for the drop, your daughter's
going to need looking after
BORDEN: Fallon can take care of-
OWENS: Bernard Fallon? A man with a past
even more obscure than your own?
The court have already motioned to
have the girl removed from his "care".
No, the girl is to be an orphan.
I've been to the work house...
Owens looks around the prison yard.  Shrugs.
OWENS (CONT'D): It's better than this.
Borden looks at Owens, hard.  The Warders unlock Borden.
OWENS (CONT'D): I'm offering you a way to warp up
your affairs with dignity, and I'm
offering your daughter a future.  As
Lord Caldlow's ward she will want
for nothing.  Ever.
(hands him a card)
Think it over.
9.
Borden absently VANISHES the card as a REFLEX.
OWENS (CONT'D): Lord Caldlow wanted you to have this-
(produces a leather
bound JOURNAL)
As a show of good faith.  He thought
it might be of interest.
A SULLEN WALDER TALKS the journal, flicks through it.
OWENS (CONT'D): Robert Angier's diary... It includes
the time he spent in Colorado learning
your trick...
Sullen hands the journal to Borden.  Borden takes it.
BORDEN: Angier never learned my trick.
OWENS: Really?  When he returned from
Colorado he mounted a version of the
Transported Man that the papers said
was better, even...
(with relish)
Than your original.
BORDEN: (acid)
If you want Angier's secret you can
dig him up and ask him for yourself.
Borden TURNS, dragging the Warders with him.
OWENS: I want your secret, Mr.Borden...
(louder)
Consider your daughter!

INT. CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY

Borden, on the bed, opens Angier's JOURNAL.  Starts to read...
ANGIER (V.O.): A cypher.  An enigma...
CUT TO:: LETTERS ON A PAGE. IN MEANINGLESS COMBINATIONS. GIBBERISH.

INT. TRAIN, MOUNTAINS -- DUSK

Aniger, with a SIGH, closes a CARDBOARD-COVERED NOTEBOOK.
OPENS his LEATHER-BOUND JOURNAL.  Starts to write.
10.
ANGIER (V.O.): ...Borden's cypher is simple-
unraveled by a single word. Now it
takes only patience.  And a passion
to know his mind.
Angier lloks up at his own reflection in the train window.

EXT. TRAIN STATION -- DUSK

No platform, no office, no sign.  Just an electric streetlight
which, as Angier watches, FLICKERS ON.  Angier, leaning
heavily on his cane limps over to the light and stares up at
it as he's never seen one before.
VOICE (O.S.): Mr.Angier? Welcome to Colorado
Springs.
Angier looks back and smiles.  A driver is looking down
expectantly from atop a STAGECOACH.  Angier hands his cane
up to the driver nd , with some difficulty, hitches his way
up to the roof of the rig.  As he does, the town of Colorado
Springs rises into view, a few hundred yards down the road,
lit brightly with ELECTRIC STREETLIGHTS.
ANGIER: (disbelief)
The whole town has electricity?
The driver nods and WHIPS the horses into action.

EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- EVENING

The Stagecoach flies along, inches from a precipitious drop.
It rounds a corner and pulls to a halt in front of the CLIFF
HOUSE INN, equal parts log cabin and crystal palace.

INT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- CONTINUOUS

The lobby  is cavernous and immaculate.  The entire STAFF of
the hotel - BELLBOYS, MAIDS, COOKS, and GARDENERS - are lined
up along the sides like a regiment of soldiers.
Angier reaches the reception desk and the smiling MANAGER.
ANGIER: Quit a reception.
MANAGER: You're our first guest of the season,
Mr.Angier.
(opens guest book)
Your telegram didn't indicate how
long you would be staying with us.
11.
ANGIER: As long as it takes.
(signs book)
I'll need a coach tomorrow to take
me up the mountain.
MANAGER: The peak is closed, sit.  For
scientific experimentation.
ANGIER: (smiles)
That's why I'm here.

EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING

A stagecoach rumbles along a dirt track,  The driver pulls
on his reigns and the coach pulls to a stop.
DRIVER: You have to walk the reat, I'm afraid,
sir.
Angier nods.  Lowers himself down to the roadway.

EXT. CLEARING, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING

Angier comes through the trees to find a wire fence with a
sign: EXTREME DANGER- NO TRESPASSING
Beyond the fence is a COMPOUND of three BARNS.  Rising from
the center barn is a 200ft steel TOWER capped with a GIANT
STEEL BALL.  GIANT ARCING BOLTS of electricity run down the
tower from the ball.  The windows of the building RADIATH
with BLUE EXPLOSIONS.
Angier stops forwards, entranced, and threads his fingers
through the fence.
He is sent FLYING backwards -- the fence has been electrified.
The tower is SHUT OFF- a door opens and a stout little MAN,
shotgun under one arm, MARCHES up to the fence.  He uses a
RUBBER PAD to pry open the fence and stands over Angier, who
is CURLED on the ground, GROWNLING in pain, trying to stand.
SHOTGUN: I'm amazed at how many of you
newspaper writers can't read mu sign.
Shotgun picks up Angier's cane and hands it to him.
ANGIER: Not the welcome I was expecting.
Shotgun RECOGNIZES Angier, AMAZED.
12.
SHOTGUN: I know you. You're that magician-the
Great Danton.
(helps Angier up)
I'm Alley.  I saw your show.  IN
London.  Seven times- you guessed
every object the audience had in
their pockets.
Angier leans on his cane and gently brushes off the dirt.
ALLEY: I'm sorry about the fence.  People
keep interfering with our work.
ANGIER: I've come to see Tesla.
ALLEY: Why?
ANGIER: He built a machine for a- for a
colleague of mine.  A long time ago.
Can you get me a meeting with him?
(off his look)
I've come a very long way.
ALLEY: Impossible, I'm afraid.
ANGIER: I've brought a lot of money.
Beat.
ALLEY: I'm sorry, Mr.Angier.  I simply can't
help you.
Alley pulls the fence closed.
ANGIER: I'll be staying at the hotel.
Indefinitely.
Alley watches Angier walk away.  He pulls something from his
pocket.
ALLEY: What am I holding?
Angier doesn't look back.
ANGIER: Your watch.
Alley GRINS, opening his hand.  He is holding a gold watch.
13.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY

Angier sits, the cardboard-bound notebook on the table in
front of him. He makes a notations in his own journal as he
deciphers Borden's words.
ANGIER (V.O.): April 3rd, 1893... a few days after
he first met me...
Angier runs his finger along the first line, translating...
BORDEN (V.O.): We were too young men at the start
of a great career...

INT. THEATRE -- NIGHT

Borden sits in the audience.  Younger- both hands intact.
BORDEN (V.O.): Two young man devoted to an
illusion...
Two rows in front sits Angier.  Similarly youthful.
BORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D): Two young men who never intended to
hurt anyone.
Onstage is a TANK. Standing beside the tank is a beautiful
young magician's assistant.  JULIA.
The magician, MILTOn, adress the audience.
MILTON: Which of you brave souls is willing
to bind this lovely young woman...
Milton GESTURES to Julia- the MEN in the crowd go wild- hands
in the air, catcalls.  Smiling radiantly, Julia selects two
young men, who SCRAMBLE up to the stage- ANGIER and BORDEN: younger, full of energy- Angier has no limp.
They spring onto stage, beside Julia and take the ROPE she
offers them.  Milton GRABS a HOOK that descends from the
flies on a chain.
Cutter is watching fron the wings.
MILTON (CONT'D): Are either of you two gentlemen
gailors?
Both shakes their hands as they start to bind Julia with the
ropes, Borden wrapping the rope around her wrists, Angier
the one around her ankles.
14.
MILTON (CONT'D): Well, I'm sure you can both tie a
strong knot...
As Borden finishes his knot tests it, it SLIPS APART.
Borden frowns, hastly RETYING it, covering.
Cutter NOTICES.
Borden finishes, glancing at julia who gives a small sign of
assent with her eyes.  As Angier finishes tying her ankles
he sneaks a light KISS on her ankle.  She frowns at him and
raises her arms.  Milton hooks the rope onto the chain.
Milton gesticulates  in the wings, Cutter signals to a
stagehand who starts HOISTING Julia into the air.
Milton wheels the tank under Julia's bare feet.  Cutter feels
for the handle of an AXE placed by his feet and pulls out a
STOPWATCH.: JULIA looks down at Angier.  They smile at each other.  Julia
DROPS into the tank with a massive splash- Milton SLAMS the
lid shut, PADLOCKS it and raises a curtain around the tank...
Cutter checks his stopwatch, grips the handle of the axe...
A grand GESTURE from Milton- the curtain around the tank
DROPS- Julia is GONE.  Milton raises the curtain again, then
with another flourish, DROPS it to reveal JULIA, beside the
tank, one arm in the air, dripping wet, smiling.
The audience erupts in APPLAUSE.  Angier smiles produly.

INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT

Angier, Borden and Julia sit around the cluttered room.
Borden is in the middle of a passionate rant-
BORDEN: Milton's squadering their goodwill
or a bunch of tired second-hand tricks-
ANGIER: (amused)
Old favourites, please.
BORDEN: What about something fresh?  He won't
even try a bullet catch-
CUTTER (O.S.): Bullet catch is suicide.
They turn.  Cutter stands in the doorway, counting out money.
15.
CUTTER (O.S.) (CONT'D): All it takes is a smart-arse volunteer
dropping a button down the barrel...
BORDEN: (indicates himself
and Angier)
Use plants-
ANGIER: He can't use plants for every trick.
JULIA: There'd be no seats left for the
punters.
BORDEN: Fine- no bullet catch.  But a real
magician tries to invent something
new, something other magicians scratch
their heads over-
CUTTER: They sells it to them for a small
fortune.
Cutter hands Angier some money.
CUTTER (CONT'D): I suposse you have such a trick,
Mr.Borden?
ANGIER: Actually, I do.
CUTTER: Care to sell it?
BORDEN: No one else could do my trick.
ANGIER: I could.
BORDEN: You don't even know what it is.
ANGIER: Show it to me twice, I'll do it.
Cutter looks at Borden, thoughtful.
CUTTER: I admire your spirit, Mr.Angier.
But if Borden here really has invented
his masterpiece it might well be
something only he can do.
16.
ANGIER: Why?
CUTTER: It might be something only he is
prepared to do.
(gestures to the props)
my illusions employer, Mr.Milton,
is a skilled showman.  But Borden's
right- he won't get his hands dirty.
You want to see what it takes to
make real magic- go to the Tenley.
There's a Chinaman there who's got
what it takes.
ANGIER: Chung Ling Soo.
BORDEN: Tickets are pricey.
CUTTER: I know a lad on the door.  You two
watch his show- whoever tells me how
he does his goldfish bowl trick gets
the prize.
ANGIER: Which is?
Cutter gives a sly smile.
CUTTER: Ten minutes onstage in front of my
old friend, Mr.Ackerman.
Angier and Borden prick up at the name.
JULIA: Who's Ackerman?
BORDEN: The most powerful theatrical agent
in London.
Cutter holds out money to Borden, who reaches for it- Cutter
grabs his wrist.  Serious.
CUTTER: I saw you drop the knot again, Borden.
JULIA: I think I had my wrist turned-
17.
CUTTER: (ignoring Julia)
Some nights you just can't get it,
can you?  If that knot slips when
Julia's on the hoist she'll break a
leg.
BORDEN: (defensive)
It's the wrong knot.  A Langford
double would hold tighter.
CUTTER: The Langford double's not a wet knot
it's too dangerous.  The ropes could
swell and she'd never slip it-
JULIA: I can slip a Lanford underwater.
BORDEN: We've been practiced it-
ANGIER: (cutting in)
He said no.
Julia glances at Angier.
CUTTER: (to Borden)
No more mistakes.
Borden stares at Cutter.  Leaves.  Angier watches him go.
ANGIER: Where's he from?
CUTTER: Where are you from?
Angier nods.  Fair enough.
CUTTER (CONT'D): He shuffles props for Virgil at the
Hall.
ANGIER: He works for another magician?  Aren't
you worried he'll steal your tricks?
CUTTER: (shakes head)
He doesn't deal in methods.
ANGIER: How do you know?
18.
CUTTER: (sly smile)
Because I hired him to try and find
out Virgil's orange trick.
ANGIER: I don't know if I trust him.
CUTTER: He's a natural magician.  Of course
you can't trust him.
JULIA: I think he's alright.
Angier turns to Julia.  Smiles.
ANGIER: You think everyone's alright.
JULIA: Even you.
Julia kisses Angier.  Cutter rises.
CUTTER: And Mr.Angier...?
(Angier looks up)
Learn your aight lines- if I can see
you sneaking a peck on your wife's
ankle from the wings, the blokes on
each end of rows 3 and 4 can, too.

INT. THEATRE, CONVENT GARDEN -- EVENING

Borden watches from the wings.  Onstage, a magician, Virgil,
locks a CANARY into a cage then covers the cage with a SHAWL.
Borden notices a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN in the front row with
a little BOY who is watching Virgil's act, spellbound.
Virgil SLAMS the SHAWL down onto the table, as if nothing
were beneath it, then WHIPS it away- BIRD and CAGE are gone.
The little BOY begins to WAIL and CRY.
Borden watches as the young woman tries to make him stop.
Virgil takes the flower from his lapel, covers it with the
shawl, and SNAPS it away- the flower has become the CANARY.
The audience bursts into enthusiastic APPLAUSE, but the little
boy is still CRYING INCONSOLABLY.  Virgil takes bows and
walks off, handing Borden the canary as he passes backstage.
As the audience leaves, Borden climbs off the stage and hols
the bird in front of the boy.
BORDEN: Look- he's all right.  He's fine.
19.
BOY: (sniffs)
But where's his brother?
Borden is at a loss.  He turns to the young woman.
BORDEN: Sharp lad, your son.
YOUNG WOMAN: (laughs)
My brother.
Borden smiles back.

INT. WORKSHOP -- LATER

Borden gently strokes the bird's feathered head.
BORDEN: You're the lucky one tonight.
Borden walks to a wall of DOZENS of bird cages -- each one
with an identical canary.  He puts the bird into its cage
and returns to the cart props.  He taps on the top of the
TABLE- a panel POPS open, revealing the FLATTENDED BIRD CAGE.
Borden insefts a ROD into the bird cage and PRIES it apart.
A TRICKLE of BLOOD emerges, dripping into a bucket below.
Borden SLAPS the cage.
And the FLATTENED CARCASS of the ORIGINAL BIRD slides out
and SPLASHES into the bucket.

EXT. STAGE DOOR -- EVENING

Borden exits.  The young woman, SARAH, is there with her
brother.
BORDEN: (to the brother)
Are you watching closely?
Borden reaches to the Boy's ear.  Casually produces a coin.
The Boy marvels as he takes the coin then looks at Borden.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Look closer.
BOY: It's got two heads.
Sarah smiles.  Borden crouches to address the Boy, grave.
BORDEN: Never.  Show.  Anyone.
20.
The Boy looks at him, a little afraid.
BORDEN (CONT'D): They'll beg you and flatter you for
the secret- but as soon as you give
it up you'll be nothing to them.
Understand?  Nothing.  The secret
impresses no one- the trick you use
it for is everything.
Borden looks into the boy's staring eyes.  Then SMILES and
pets him on the head.  he stands.  Sarah smiles at him.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Where do you two live?
SARAH: He lives with Mum.
BORDEN: And you?

INT. STAIRWELL -- EVENING

Sarah lingers at the top of the stairs to her flat.  Borden
tries to KISS her, but she pushes him back.  He tests the
LOCK of the open door.
BORDEN: Enough to keep me out?
SARAH: I think so.  Wil I see you again?
Borden SHRUGS and turns to go back down the stairs.  Sarah
looks after him, about to change her min.  Hesitates.

INT. SARAH'S FLAT -- CONTINUOUS

She closes the door and LOCKS it, smiling.  After a moment
she pads through living/kitchen area, draws back the curtain
to her bedroom and SHRIEKS: Borden is there, smiling.  Sarah moves towards him, giggling.

INT. TENLEY THEATRE -- NIGHT

Onstage, CHUNG LING SOO, 60's, wearing a long silk robe,
HOBBLES painfully to the center of the stage.  Clearly
CRIPPLED.  In the audience, Borden and Angier watch intently.
Soo lays a silk SHAWL and a BARE TABLE.  He WHIPS it up,
revealing a BOUQUET OF ROSES.  So repeats the trick again
and again, producing a different object each time.
Finally, with a drum roll, Soo whips the shawl aside to reveal
a MASSIVE GOLDFISH BOWL, complete with GOLDFISH.
21.
To THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE, Soo bows and HOBBLES off the stage.
Angier, clapping, shakes his head, utterly baffled.  He turns
to Borden.  Who has a small, knowing, smile.

EXT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

Borden and Angier watch Soo being helped down from his
carriege by HANDLERS who treat him with great gentleness.
ANGIER: You're wrong.  It can't be.
BORDEN: It is.  He carries the bowl between
his knees for the entire performance.
ANGIER: but look at the man!
BORDEN: (points)
This is the trick.  This is why no
one detectes his method.
Soo hobbles into the restaurant, frail, and fragile.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Total devotion to his art...
(looks at Angier)
Utter self-sacrifice.  It's the only
way to escape this.
Borden SLAPS the bricks of the wall behind them.

INT. BEDSIT -- NIGHT

Julia, in bed, watches Angier, SHEET wrapped around him like
a robe, HOBBLING.  He pulls up the sheeyt- between his knees
is a goldfish bowl.
ANGIER: I can barely lift this thing and
it's not even filled with water.  Or
fish.  He must be strong as an ox.
JULIA: (incredulous)
He's been preteding to be an cripple
for years?
ANGIER: Any time he's in public.  Any time
he goes out.  It's unthinkable.
Angier puts the bowl down with a flourish.  Climbs into bed.
22.
ANGIER (CONT'D): Borden saw it at once.  I couldn't
fathom it- living your whole life
pretending to be someone else.
JULIA: You're pretending to be someone else.
ANGIER: I don't think changing your name
compares.
JULIA: Not just your name- who you are,
where you're from...
ANGIER: I promised my family I wouldn't
embarrass them with my theatrical
endeavors.
Angier cuddles up to Julia.
JULIA: I came up with a name for you...
"The Great Danton"
(Angier frowns)
You don't like it?  It's
sophisticated.
ANGIER: It's French.

INT. BEDSIT -- DAY

Sarah unlocks the door, but has to PUSH against MAGICAL PROPS
stacked against it- the bedsit is FILLED with DEVICES.
SARAH: Alfred?!
Sarah surveys the confusion- spots Borden across the flat
deep in conversation with another man.  Borden spots her-
BORDEN: We have our routine for Ackerman!
The other man turns- it is Fallon.
SARAH: (cold)
We haven't had the pleasure.
Fallon nods.  Borden comes over, holding a DUELING PISTOL.
BORDEN: Mr.Fallon is my ingeneur-
23.
SARAH: Where did yo get all of-
BORDEN: Begged, borrowed  and don't ask.
Mr.Fallon's an enterprising soul.
SARAH: I need talk to you.
Fallon slips past Sarah with a nod to Borden.  Exits.  Sarah
looks at Borden.  TENSE.
SARAH (CONT'D): We can't afford to pay him-
BORDEN: We'll start making money once we
have our audience-
SARAH: And until then?  What I earn is barely
enough for us.
BORDEN: (shrugs)
I'll give him half of my food.
Sarah looks meaningfully at Borden.
SARAH: You're already going to be sharing
it with someone else.
Borden looks at her, confused.  Then realizes.
BORDEN: You're...?
SARAH: Having a baby.
Borden freezes. Then SMILES, taking her in his arms.  She
FLINCHES against the gun he is holding.
SARAH (CONT'D): What's this?
BORDEN: The trick to wake up Ackerman at the
end of my audition.
SARAH: Your great trick?  The "masterpiece
that will make our fortunes"?
24.
BORDEN: No. The world isn't ready for that
one, yet.
Borden moves to the bureau and starts LOADING the gun.
Pouring in SHOT, then WADDING...
BORDEN (CONT'D): This is merely a run-of-the-mill
daring and spectacular bullet catch-
Borden drops the BULLET into the barrel...
SARAH: I'm not letting you get shot.
Borden RAMS the bullet and charge down then removes the RAMROD
and hands the pistol to Sarah.
BORDEN: It's perfectly safe.  Shoot me.
Sarah looks at Borden then down at the pistol.  She aims at
Borden.  Then sims off, at a mirror beside him.
BANG.  Borden's hand SNAPS out to "catch" the bullet.  The
mirror is intact.
Borden looks at Sarah, grave, as he reveals the bullet in
his hand.
SARAH: Show me.
(Borden shakes head)
Then you're not doing it.  I can't
raise a child on my own, Alfred.
Borden looks at her.  Takes the bullet from her and places
it on the bureau.
BORDEN: The bullet goes in the gun.  Then
comes the ramrod.
He takes the RAMROD and PUSHES it down onto the bullet, which
disappears.
BORDEN (CONT'D): And voils-
He points the ramrod at Sarah- she pulls the bullet out of
the HOLLOW TIP.
BORDEN (CONT'D): The buller's not even in the gun
when the charge is fired.
Sarah looks at ramrod with disdain.
25.
SARAH: Once you know it's so obvious.
Borden BRISTLES slightly.  Takes the bullet back.
BORDEN: Yes, well, people still get killed
perfoming it.
SARAH: How?
BORDEN: Sme smart-arse drops something down
the barrel.
SARAH: Such as?
BORDEN: A penny, or a button.  Or, of course,
a bullet.
(off worried look)
But don't fret-
Borden embraces her, putting his hand on her belly.
BORDEN (CONT'D): I'm not letting anything happen- I
love you too much.
Sarah grabs his face, looking at his eyes, smiling.
SARAH: Say it again.
BORDEN: I love you.
SARAH: (matter-of-fact)
Nope.  Not today.
BORDEN: What?
SARAH: (smiles)
Some days, it's not true.  Todayt
you don't mean it.  Maybe today you're
more in love with magic than me.
(off look)
It's alright.  I like being able to
tell the difference- it makes the
days it is true mean something.
Borden shakes his head, grinning.
26.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- NIGHT

Angier closes Borden's notebook.  He looks across at a
photograph of julia on the table.  Reaches for his own diary.
ANGIER (V.O.): Borden writes as if no one but he
understood the true nature of magic...

INT. CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY

Borden sits on his cot reading Angier's journal.
ANGIER (V.O.): ...but what does he know of self-
sacrifice more than the rest of us?
Borden looks up from Angier's journal.
BORDEN: Bloody fool.
Borden TOSSES the book across the cell.

INT. EVIDENCE ROOM, WARHOUSE -- DAY

A POLICEMAN opens the door for the Judge and Cutter.
POLICEMAN: (pointing)
It's all laid out down the end, you
honour.
The Judge NODS.  The Policeman exits, LOCKING them inside.
The Judge follows Cutter, approaching a collection of magical
apparatus, including a MASSIVE CRATE.  Cutter looks up at it
with AWE, touching the side where it says  "COLORADO SPRINGS".
JUDGE: What's in there?
Cutter OPENS it, revealing metal and glass MACHINERY within.
CUTTER: Angier's machine.
JUDGE: You built this, Mr.Cutter?
CUTTER: (shakes head)
Oh  no. This wasn't built by a
magician... it was built by a wizard.
(off look)
A man who can actually do the things
a magician pretends to...
27.
Cutter closes the crats.  The JUDGE turns to other props.
CUTTER (CONT'D): your honour, what will happen to
these things when the trial is over?
The Judge is staring at a large glass tank.
JUDGE: They've benn sold to a Lord Caldlo.
An avid collector, apparently very
interested in the case.
CUTTER: Don't let him take this.
The Judge looks over.  Cutter is touching the crate.
JUDGE: Why ever not?
CUTTER: It's dangerous.
JUDGE: I'm sure beneath its bells and
whistles it's get some simple and
disappointing trick.
CUTTER: The most disappointing of all- it
has no trick.  It's real.
The Judge looks at Cutter.  Smiles indulgently.  Turns.
JUDGE: This is the tank Angier drowned in?
Cutter turns to look at the empty, smashed glass of the tank.
Nods.  Cutter indicates the top of the tank, where there is
a PADLOCK.  Cutter pushes down on a panel of the lid-
CUTTER: This lets the performer's hands reach
the trick padlock...
-a small section POPS open.
JUDGE: A standard magical apparatus for
escapes?
CUTTER: With one important difference...
Cutter grabs the PADLOCK.  Rattles it.
28.
CUTTER (CONT'D): This isn't a trick lock... it's been
switched out for a real one.
The Judge stares at the tank, appaled.
JUDGE: What a way to kill someone.  Why in
God's name go to such lengths?
CUTTER: These are magicians, you honour.
Showmen.  Men who live by dressing
up plain and sometimes brutal truths
to amaze. To shock.
JUDGE: Even without and audience?
Cutter stares at the tank-
INSERT CUT: ANGIER SCREAMING BUBBLES.
CUTTER: There was and audience.
(looks at Judge)
See, the water tank had a particular
signinficance for the two men...

INT. THEATRE -- EVENING

Onstage, A SIMILAR TANK FILLED WITH WATER.
CUTTER (V.O.): A particular awful significance...
Julia stands next to the tank.  Milton adresses the audience.
MILTON: Which of you brave souls is willing
bind this lovely young woman?
Milton gestures to Julia- the crowd goes wild.  Julia makes
a show of deciding.  She picks up Angier and Borden, who are
made up to look different from the last performance.  As
they leap up onto stage, Borden makes eye contact with Cutter
in the wings- Cutter's is a WARNING GLANCE.
As Angier ties Julia's ankles he can't resist tickling just
under her toes- she KICKS him in the chin.
Borden starts to wrap the rope around Julia's wrists in a
particular fashion.  Stops.  Reconsiders.  Julia NODS at
him, encouring.  Borden starts RETRYING the knot.
Cutter watches.  His hand checking for the axe handle.
29.
Borden tests the rope- it is tight.  Julia gives him the
sign with her eyes- he steps back.  Angier rises to his feet,
grinning at Julia.  As she raises her arms to the hook, she
can't quite hide her smile back at him.
Milton gives the sign and Julia is HOISTED into the air.
Cutter slips his STOPWATCH out of his pocket as Milton moes
the tank under Julia's bare feet.
Angier looks up at Julia.  Proud.  She stares out over the
audience, preparing herself.  Looks down at Angier, smiling...
Julia PLUNGES into the tank- Milton SLAMS the lid shut- Cutter
checks his stopwatch, hand caressing the axe handle...
Milton raises the curtain around the tank, then circles it,
working his "magic".  Angier shifts a little.  Time passing...
Milton looks at Cutter- TOO MUCH TIME...
Cutter GRASPS his axe and SPRINT at the tank- Milton RIPS
the curtain down- Julia, one arm free, is CONVULSING...
Angier and Borden look on in HORROR as Cutter SWINGS his axe
into the glass- which CRACKS... cutter SWINGS again and again-
the web of crackes GROWING, Julia's convulsions SLOWING, her
eyes PLEADING with Angier's, until-
CRASH- the glass gives way, FLOODING the stage- Cutter and
Angier GRASP at Julia- FULL her onto the stage- Cutter ELBOWS
Angier out of the way to POUND on Julia's chest- Borden
wacthes, stunned, as Julia FLOPS, LIFELESS, onto the boards.
Cutter looks up at Angier, stricken.
Angier takes Julia in his arms, looking down at her staring
eyes.  He desperately BRUSHES water from Julias cheeks and
forehead.  Borden looks on, shen.
BORDEN (V.O.): How often I've fought with my self
over that night .. one half of me
swearing bling that i tied a simple
slip knot... the other half convinced
that I tied the Langford double.  I
suppose I'll never know for sure-

INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY

Angier looks up from Borden's journal, despairing.
ANGIER: How can be not know?!
Angier FLINGS Borden's journal across the room.
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D): He must know what he did.  He must.
30.

INT. PRISON CELL -- DAY

Borden smiles as he reads Angier's dairy.
BORDEN: "How can be not know?!"
(starts lauhing)
Because, Angier, life is complicated,
people are complicated, knots are
complicated-
PRISONER (O.S.): Shit it, Professor, or I'll shut it
for you.
Borden quiets.  Looking at the journal.
BORDEN (V.O.): How could I not know?  How can you
read my story and not understand?

INT. COURTROOM -- DAY

Cutter sits in the CROWDED GALLERY.  Borden, in the dock,
SCANS the crowd.  Finally SPOTS Fallon pushing to the front-
he is alone.  Borden stares at him.  Fallon shakes his dead.
Borden is prompted to stand by two GUARDS as the Judge enters.
The JUDGE has a piece of black cloth draped over his wig.
JUDGE: Alfred Borden, you have been found
guilty of the murder of Robert Angier.
You will, in one month's time, be
hanged by the neck until dead.  May
the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Borden barely reacts.

EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY

Borden stands at the fence with Fallon
BORDEN: They took her away?
(Fallon nods)
To the workhouse?
Another slow nod.  Borden closes his eyes with despair. Then
opens them and hands Fallon OWENS' CARD.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Tell him I've reconsidered.
(off look)
It's for the best.
31.

INT. DINING ROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN, COLORADO SPRING -- DUSK

Angier stares down at the NOTEBOOK, making notes on a napkin.
Through large windows a THUNDERSTORM batters Pike's Peak.
Angier is the only guest in the hotel's massive dining room.
VOICE (O.S.): Mind if I join you?
Angier looks around.  Alley is standing by the table.
ALLEY: Tesla sends me down here during the
storms.  Perfect excuse to come shere
a drink with the Great Danton.
Alley sits, gesturing to a waiter.
ALLEY (CONT'D): Have you tried our Bourbon yet, Mr.
Angier?  It matches the scenery
nicely.
(to waiter)
Two of 'em.
(to Angier)
Beautiful, isn't it?  I do miss New
York, though.
ANGIER: Why are you here?
ALLEY: The lightning lives here.  And noit
much else- our work is secret.
Alley glances down at the notebook and Agier's scribbles.
ALLEY (CONT'D): A cypher?
Angier nods as Alley lifts the cardboard notebook.
ANGIER: My profession also deals in secrets.
Alley looks at the gibberish on the pages of the notebook.
ANGIER (CONT'D): It's a rotating transposition that
shifts every day of the dairy.  Simple
but time-consuming to translate once
you have the five-letter keyword.
ALLEY: Which is?
Angier smiles as he reaches for the notebook.
32.
ANGIER: We magicians have a circle of trust.
ALLEY: You have a circle of trust with
someone whose dairy you stole?
ANGIER: Maybe I bought it.
ALLEY: Magicians sell their secrets?
ANGIER: It's how we pay for our retirements
and how greats tricks outlive us.
Alley considers this.  Taps the cover of the notebook.
ALLEY: You're hoping to find a great secretin
there?
ANGIER: I've already found it.  That's why
I'm here.
Angier reaches in his pocket and removes his own, leather-
bound journal.  He tears a PAGE from it and hands it to Alley.
Who unfolds it ans stares at it.
ANGIER (CONT'D): Tesla built one for another magician.
ALLEY: Why would you want the same thing?
ANGIER: Call it a professional rivalry.
ALLEY: Tesla has built unusual machines for
unusual people, but he would never
talk about it.
ANGIER: I understand discretion.  I just
want the machine.
Alley looks at Angier.  Thinking.
ALLEY: Finish your drink.  You'll have a
special appreciation for our work.
ANGIER: I thought it was a secret.
33.
ALLEY: (smiles)
You're a magician.  Who's going to
believe you?

EXT. FIELDS, COLORADO SPRINGS -- NIGHT

The storm has abated.  Angier's cane into the muddy ground
as he follows Alley through the moonlit field.
There are large glass GLOBES pushing out of the soil as if
planted all around them.  They stop in the middle of the
field, looking down at the electric LIGHTS of the town.
ALLEY: We do our tests when the townspeople
are asleep- Mr.Tesla doesn't want to
scare anyone.
Alley checks his wacth by the moonlight.
ALLEY (CONT'D): Not long now.
As they watch, the lights of Colorado Springs DISAPPEAR.
ALLEY (CONT'D): Our equipment requires a great deal
of current.  Tesla eletrified the
whole town in exchange for using the
generators when we need to.
The field around them EXPLODES with DAZZLING LIGHT.  Angier
laughs out in surprise- the field is full of a thousand large
LIGHTBULBS, all glowing together.  Alley bends down and picks
up the nearest lightbulb -- as he does, the light in it
extinguises.  He tosses the bulb to Angier. Except for the
size, it's a normal lightbulb.
ANGIER: Where are the wires?
ALLEY: Exactly.
Angier bends and gently PUSHES the lightbulb into a random
spot in the wet soil.  The lightbulb FLICKERS on again.
ANGIER: Where's the generator?
ALLEY: You saw it last week.
ANGIER: But that must be ten miles from here.
34.
ALLEY: Fifteen.  And I have to ride all of
them before I get to bed.
(turns to leave)
I'll send word for you in a few days,
Mr.Angier.
Angier bends to pick up his lightbulb.  As he does, the light
FADES in all of them, and the lights in town come back on.
Angier is alone.

INT. BATHROOM, LONDON -- DAY

Angier has his head SUBMERGED in a sink full of water.  He
BURSTS FREE, GASPING- COLLA`PSES to the floor, SOBBING.

INT. BATHROOM -- LATER

Angier lays out MAKE-UP SUPPLIES.  He takes out a BULLE.
Places it on the sink next to a FALSE MOUNSTAGE.

EXT. PRINCE'S ARMS BAR AND THEATRE

Rough.  Unwelcoming. Crowded.  A small "stage" at one end: Borden works his way through the Chinese rings.  The crowd
is JEERING.
VOICE: Get out your gun, Professor!
Someone BURLS a bottle at the stage- it narrowly misses.
Borden GLARES out into the audience.  Pulls out his GUN.
BORDEN: A volunteer.
The crowd SURGES forward with EAGER VOLUNTEERS.  Fallon scans
the crowd, passing over too-eager and too-drunk before
settling on a MOUNSTACHED MAN and bringing him up onstage.
Borden LOADS the pistol, hands it to Moustache and steps
backwards, pulling his coat apart, CHALLENGING.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Are you man enought, sir?
MOUSTACHE: (quiet)
Yes.
Something in Moustache's tone makes Borden looks closely-
behind the moustache... Angier.  QUIVERING WITH TENSION.
35.
Borden looks at the trembling gun.  Then at Angier.  Spreads
his hands, inviting.
BORDEN: (smiles)
I think not.
Angier purses his lips, straining to pull the trigger.
INSERT CUT: JULIA'S FACE, SCREAMING BUBBLES...
Angier's eyes are almost closed as he SQUEEZES the TRIGGER-
Fallon HITS Angier JUMPS to Borden's side, GRABBING his
BLEEDING HAND.  The DROWS is SCREAMING, PUSHING for the door,
os STRAINING for a closer look at Borden.
Aniger, SHOCKED, melts into the crowd.

INT. PUB -- DAY

Angier sits at the bar.  Staring.  He raises his pint glass.
Downs it, then STOPS, looking at the bottom- there is a
PLAYING CARD.  He loos around. Cutter is sitting at a table
with two fresh pints in front of him.  Angier heads over.
ANGIER: Never thought I'd find an answer at
the bottom of a pint glass.
CUTTER: Hasn't stopped you looking.
(Angier sits)
I heard about a booking.  Nice little
theatre.  Good up-and-coming magician.
ANGIER: Who?
CUTTER: You.
ANGIER: You got me a booking? Why?
Cutter looks down into his beer.
CUTTER: Because I want to keep working...
(looks up at Angier)
And who's going to hire the ingeneur
who killed Julia McCullough in front
of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?
Angier looks back at Cutter.
36.
ANGIER: Someone who know that it wasn't your
fault.  Someone who knows Alfred
Borden and his repertoire of exotic
knots.
CUTTER: Heard he had a spot of bad luck doing
a bullet catch South of the river.
Angier looks down at the liquid in his glass.
ANGIER: To die like that.  Locked in water...
lungs screaming...
(shakes head)
What did she go through, Cutter?
Cutter watches Angier's distress.
CUTTER: I knew an old sailor.  Told me about
a time he got pulled over the side
tangled in the sheets... they dragged
him out, but it was five minutes
before he coughed...
Angier stares at Cutter.  Hanging.
CUTTER (CONT'D): He said it was like... going home.
Angier considers this.  Collects himself.
ANGIER: Which knot did Borden tie that night?
CUTTER: He wouldn't say.
ANGIER: Wouldn't say?!
CUTTER: It was as if... as if he didn't know.

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Angier and Cutter isspect a large empty room.
CUTTER: We'll have to whitewash the windows
to cofound the more curious members
of your audience...
(looks around)
But this should do.
37.
ANGIER: We should see about an assistant.
CUTTER: I've made arrangements.  Have you
settled on a name?
ANGIER: Yes, I have.  The Great Danton.
CUTTER: Hmm.  Bit old-fashioned?
Angier smiles gently at Cutter.
ANGIER: No. It's sophisticated.

INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

Angier is sitting at a worktable, pensive.  He is moving one
hand across the other, making a ROSE appear and disappear.
The windows have been WHITEWASHED and the room has filled
with an array of magical apparati: cabinets, costumes, props.
On the other side of the room Cutter watches as OLIVIA
WENSCOMBE, 20s, equal parts grace and mischief, squeezes
herself into a tall cabinet, looking past Cutter to Angier.
OLIVIA: What's so hard about this?
Cutter leans into the cabinet and pops up a TRICK PANEl in
the floor, revealing a tiny chamber.
CUTTER: In here, Miss Wenscombe.  No point
meeting Mr.Angier unless you fit.
Olivia shrugs and hands Cutter her hat, then her thick skirts,
and folds herself into the bottom of the box.
CUTTER (CONT'D): Breathe as little as possible.
Cutter closes the lid over her and walks over to Angier.
CUTTER (CONT'D): Not much experience , but she knows
the basics.  She knows how to present
herself and a pretty assistant's the
most effective from of misdirection.
Angier nods.  There is a small SNEEZE from inside the cabinet.
CUTTER (CONT'D): (smiles)
I suppose I should let her out.
38.

INT. SARAH'S FLAT -- DAY

Sarah is frantcally REDRESSIN Borden's injured hand.  BLOOD
has SEEPED trough the bandages.
SARAH: I don't understand, Alfred.  How can
it be bleeding again?
She examines the wounds: 2 1/2 FINGERS ARE MISSING.  The
injuries are black, but wet and fresh.
SARAH (CONT'D): What have you been doing to it?  It
looks as had as the day it happened.
We need to get the doctot back-
BORDEN: (snaps)
We can' afford the doctor back!
A BABY STARTS CRYING in the bedroom.  Sarah glares at Borden.
SARAH: You've woken her.
BORDEN: I'm sorry.  I just need this to heal
so I can het back to work.
Sarah looks at Borden.  Reluctantly.
SARAH: Alfred, you have to face things.
What tricks could you peform with
this kind of injury?
BORDEN: Some of the card pulls, prop tricks...
(leans forward, excited)
And the trick I've been telling you
about.  The trick they'll remember
me for.

INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

Angier and Cutter at the workbench, examine a BIRD CAGE.
Cutter is wearing a strange LEATHER HARNESS over his shirt
it has LARGE SPRINGS and small PULLEYS on the back.
ANGIER: The bird cage can't be our climax-
everybody knows it.
CUTTER: Not like this, they don't.
39.
ANGIER: And I don't want to kill doves.
CUTTER: (snaps)
Then stay off the stage.
(glares at Angier)
You're a magician, not a wizard- you
have to get your hands dirty to
achieve the impossible.
ANGIER: You sound like him.
CUTTER: (holds up cage)
Put your hands on the sides...

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY

A heavy, disinterested man slouches in the third row of the
empty theatre with a newspaper- MERRIT, the stage manager.
Onstage, Angier energetically YANKS coloured handkerchiefs
from a hat and TOSSING them into the air.  Olivia, in the
glamorous, revealing costume of Magician's Assistant, darts
back and forth PLUCKING the handkerchiefs from the air.
Angier finishes with a flourish.  Merrit shrugs.  Angier
places an ORNATE CAGE onto the table.
ANGIER: I need a volunteer.
Merrit rolls his eyes.  Climbs to his feet.  Angier produces
a DOVE.  Places it in the cage.

INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

Now Angier is wearing the harness.  He places a dove in the
cage and picks it up.
Close on: HOOKS concealed on Angier's palm slip into CATCHES
on the bars of the cage.
CUTTER: Hang on, hang on...
Cutter reaches in and slips a NOOSE around the bird's ankle...
CUTTER (CONT'D): There we go.  Now you tell the
volunteer to put his hands here...
Cutter pleases his hands on the TOP and BOTTOM of the cage...
40.

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT

Merrit places his hands on the TOP and BOTTOM of the bird
cage.  Angier's hands are on the sides.  Olivia reaches around
Merrit to place her hands on the remaining two sides.  Merrit
looks up at Angier  over his glasses.
MERRIT: You'd beat not be intending to hut
this animal, Mr.Angier.
ANGIER: Of course not.
Angier raises and lowers their hands in a rythm...
ANGIER (CONT'D): And one, two... THREE!
The bird cage, and the dove, VANISH.

INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

Angier and Cutter have their hands on the bird cage.
ANGIER:
...THREE!: The bird cage BREAKS APART, WHIPPING UP ANGIER'S FOREARMS.
WHERE SLEEVES WOULD BE, YANKED BY THE HARNESS.  Angier smiles.
ANGIER (CONT'D): Bloody marvelous, Cutter.
CUTTER: And the best part...
Cutter reaches to Angier's armpit... pulls up the DOVE,
HANGING BY ITS ANKLE, ALIVE.
ANGIER: Thought you said I had to get my
hands dirty.
CUTTER: Someday, perhaps you will.  I needed
to know that you can.

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY

Merrit nods, impressed, stepping backwards.  Angier REACHES
into Merrit's pocket.  Removes a dove.
MERRIT: Very nice.  Very nice indeed.
Olivia packs up the props.  Cutter approaches from the wings.
41.
ANGIER: (smiling)
I haven't had a chance to compliment
you on your beautiful theatre yet,
Mr.Merrit.
MERRIT: A lot more beautiful when it's full,
Mr.Angier.
ANGIER: Don't worry.
MERRIT: You all say that. Why sould I worry?
If your tricks don't get 'em in,
someone else's will.  Maybe someone
willing to do a bullet catch or a
water scape.
CUTTER: cheap thrills, Mr.Merrit. People
hoping for an accident- and quite
likely to see one, too.  What would
that do for your business?
MERRIT: (shrugs)
You've got a week.

EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING

A line a PATRONS runs from the box office to the street.
The marquee above the theatre reads: "THE GREAT DANTON PERFOMS
FEATS OF MISTERY AND IMAGINATION"

INT. THEATRE -- EVENING

Angier is perfoming to a good crowd.  He steps forward.
ANGIER: You sir, in the hat.  Could you show
us your handkerchief?
A MAN in the audience STANDS and pulls a HANDKERCHIEF from
his pocket.  He stares at it, CONFUSED.  The audience LAUGHS.
MAN: This isn't mine.
ANGIER: Perhaps you'd be so good as to return
it to the other man.  He has yours.
Another man stands and pulls out a handkerchief.  APPLAUSE.
Angier dows and walks quickly off the stage, past the squad
of DANCING GIRLS who run on to entertain in the break.
42.

INT. BACKSTAGE -- EVENING

Cutter and Olivia are waiting for Angier as he comes off.
OLIVIA: I'm so nervous- I'm sorry, I'm making
mistakes.
Cutter quickly REMOVES Angier's coat...
ANGIER: The audience doesn't seem to be
responding much, Cutter.
Cutter puts he LEATHER HARNESS over Angier's arms...
CUTTER: This is a grand theatre with a
sophisticated audience-  They've
seen most of these tricks before.
But not this next one.  You'll see.
Cutter checks the SPRINGS of the harness and replaces Angier's
coat.  He spots a STAGEHAND poking his head around the flies.
CUTTER (CONT'D): You!  Piss off out it!
The dancers are wrapping up.
ANGIER: Wish us luc, Cutter.
CUTTER: (smiling)
I'll have the champagne ready.
Angier, followed by Olivia, steps out onto the stage.

INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Angier steps to the table center stage.  Pulls out the bird
cage.  There are one or two groans from the audience.  Angier
SMILES as he produces a DOVE with a FLOURISH.
ANGIER: You've seen this one before?
HECKLER (O.S.): Seen 'em all before, mate!
Laughter.
ANGIER: Well, I'll make it a little harder,
shall I?
In the wings, Cutter smiles and nods at Angier's showmanship.
43.
ANGIER (CONT'D): Two volunteers, please.  A lady and
a gentleman to hold this cage with
me...
Hands go up.  Olivia pulls an ELEGANT LADY from the audience.
ANGIER (CONT'D): I'll perform this feat in a manner
never before seen by yourselves or
by any other audience anywhere in
the worth...
Olivi brings Elegant Lady onto the stage along with a RED-
BEARDED MAN.  The audience is getting interested.  Angier is
on role...
ANGIER (CONT'D): Any magician can make this cage
disappear... that's why I'll ask
this good lady and fine gentleman to
place their hands firmly on the
cage...
Olivia guides Elegant Lady's hands onto the sides of the
cage.  Red-beard places a hand underneath the cage.
ANGIER (CONT'D): ...to ensure that no trickery
whatsover is employed.
Angier RAISES the bird cage.  The audience is RAPT.
Red beard's other hand appears on the top of the cage- it is
MUTILATED, missing fingers.
Angier FREEZES- looks up at Red Beard... IT IS BORDEN
Borden SMILES as he WORMS his little finger into the cage
mechanism...
SNAP!  HALP THE CAGE WHIPS UP ANGIER'S SLEEVE- THE OTHER
HALF COLLAPSES ON THE DOVE AND THE ELEGANT LADY'S FINGERS-
SHE SCREAMS- BIRD BLOOD SPLATTERS ONTO THE THREE OF THEN-
THE AUDIENCE GOES CRAZY-
Borden smiles at Angier through his blood-spattered fake
beard and retreats into the chaos surrounding the Elefant
Lady who is still SCREAMING as Angier tries to free her
fingers from the mechanism.

INT. BACKSTAGE -- LATER

Angier and Cutter watch the STAGEHANDS clear the stage.
ANGIER: I should've spotted him.
44.
CUTTER: You had a lot of plates spinning.
Angier looks down at the harness in his hands.
ANGIER: Don't suppose they'll let us do this
one again.
CUTTER: No.
ANGIER: So what's the climax of our show?
MERRIT (O.S.): Show?  You don't have a show.
ANGIER: Mr.Merrit, we have a week's engagment-
MERRIT: To perform magic- not butcher birds
and break my costomer's fingers!
Clear out, anything here in the
morning gets burned.
Cutter puts his hand on Merrit's arms.
CUTTER: Mr.Merrit-
MERRIT: It's done, John.  I've hired a
comedian.  You know I hate comedians,
which should indicate the may I felel
about your friend's future as a stage
magician.
Cutter nods.  Merrit leaves.  Cutter turns to Angier.
CUTTER: There are plenty of good theatres...
if we can come up with another trick
and change the name of the act-
ANGIER: The name stays.
Cutter sees Angier's resolve.
CUTTER: Right.  Well, the new trick will
have to be irresistible, then.  I've
a couple of methods to try out, but
we'll need a fresh angle on the
presentation.
45.
Angier nods.
CUTTER (CONT'D): If you need inspiration, there's a
technical exposition at the Albert
Hall this week.  Scientists and
engineers.  That sort of thing
captures the popular imagination.

EXT. ROYAL ALBERT HALL -- AFTERNOON

The large concert hall is surrounded by crowds and covered
in banners advertising a Technical Exposition.  Angier makes
his way past a giant STEAM ENGINE and into the building.

INT. ALBERT HALL -- AFTERNOON

THe lobby if filled with displays and models.  Angiers pokes
around, looking thouroughly disinterested until he comes to
an information booth plastered with illustrations of
electrical bolts.
TICKET HAWKER: Would you like to know the future,
sir? The man who kill change the
world is speaking right now.
Continents divided no more.  Free,
clean power. The mysteries of the
world solved.
The posters show a tall, handsome man bathed in lightning
and standing astride the world like colossus.  In bold print
it says: THE WONDERS OF "ALTERNATING CURRENT"...NIKOLA TESLA

INT. AUDITORIUM, ALBERT HALL -- CONTINUOUS

The hall is completely darkened, but bright blue FLASHES
illuminate ANGIER as he pushes his way to a seat.
On the stage, a tall rod capped with a steel ball is
transmitting a steady, sparking stream of electricity onto a
matched ball across the stage.
A FIGURE walks around from behind the machine and the audience
GASPS as a shower of sparks bounce off of his immaculate
evening wear.  This is TESLA- but Angier is too far from the
stage to get a good look at him.
TESLA: With a system like this I could have
the entire city electrified whitin
two years.
The audience breaks into LAUGHTER.  The spell is broken.
Tesla must be a lunatic.
46.
TESLA (CONT'D): Mr. Edison's direct current system
is flawed and dangerous.  With my
alternating current devices-
Someone from the audience chimes in:
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (yells)
Fraud.
Angier turns to look.  The man who called out is leaving
he's not alone.  Angier FREEZES, staring down at aisle-
Borden is sitting there, RAPT, lit by FLASHES from the
machinery on stage.  As tesla continues his demonstration,
Angier STARES at Borden.

EXT. STREET -- DAY

Borden walks down the street.  Angier is following him.
Borden meets Sarah, pushing a PRAM.  Borden looks down at
the baby then up at Sarah.
BORDEN: I love you.
Sarah smiles.
SARAH: See?  Today, it's true.
Angier watches Borden kiss wife then his baby.
ANGIER (V.O.): I saw hapiness...

INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- NIGHT

Angier writing in his leather-bound journal.
ANGIER (V.O.): ...hapiness that should have been
mine.  But I was wrong.
Angier glances at Borden's notebook sitting on the desk.
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D): Reading his account I realize that
he never had  the life I envied.
Angier flips open the notebook.  Staring at the coded writing.
ANGIER (CONT'D): The family life he craves one minute
he rails against the next, demanding
freedom.  His mind is a divided one...
47.

INT. PRISON CELL -- DAY

Borden sits on his cot.  Reading Angier's journal.
ANGIER (V.O.): His soul restless.  His wife and
child tormented by his fickle and
contradictory nature...
Borden is crying.  He puts the journal down and jumps to his
feet BANGING on the cell door.
BORDEN: Guard!  Guard!!
The viewing slot slides open.
GUARD: What do want, Professor?
BORDEN: Paper and pencil.  Please.

INT. PRISON LIBRARY, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY

Te library is long and titled, with two long tables.  It
looks as if it used to be a latrine.
Borden sits at a table.  Writing on a stack of notepaper.
His arms have been unbound, but long chains runs from his
ellbows to where Sullen Gaurd sits smoking, craning his nek
to read Borden's writing.
SULLEN: Let me see?
Sullen SNATCHES up the papers.  Borden makes no move to stop
him.  The top sheet is a sketch of a cabinet.
SULLEN (CONT'D): I'm going to know all of the
Professor's secrets.
BORDEN: (smiling)
Only if I teach you how to read.
Sullen mashes the papers into a ball and drops them.
SULLEN: Just stupid tricks, right?  Haven't
helped you get out of here-
(tugs chains))
Have they?  Or can't you open real
locks, Professor?
48.
BORDEN: Perhaps I'm just biding my time.
Perhaps one day I'll just hold up my
hand-
Borden produces a RUBBER BALL in front of Sullen's face.
Sullen stares.
BORDEN (CONT'D): -get you attention.  Then quietly
say-
(whispers)
"are you wacthing closely"... perhaps
say a magic word or two... then I'll
be gone.
Borden VANISHES the ball, but FUMBLES it, it drops to Borden's
feet.  Sullebn LAUGHS as Borden SCRABBLEs around his ankles
to retrieve the ball.
SULLEN: How'd you get so famous, then?
Borden STANDS.
BORDEN: Magic.
Borden TURNS, NO LONGER CHAINED.  Sullen JUMPS to his feet
to follow, but HIS ANKLE IS CHAINED TO THE TABLE.  The other
PRISONERS are LAUGHING and CHEERING.
SULLEN: Oi, Borden, get back here!
Sullen FUMBLES with his keys as Borden takes a BOW.  Another
warder CRACKS Borden over the head with a TRUNCHEON.  Sullen,
now free, KICKS Borden in the ribs.
CUT TO:: CLOSE ON AN ADVERTISSIMENT: "the professor has DEFIED DEATH
to return with a new SPECTACULAR!"   Pull wider-

INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT

A NEWSPAPER on the makeup table.  Angier sits at the mirror.
He hubs BROWN PASTE into his hair and then combs it out.
Then he chooses a beard, seats it on his chin and begins to
adjust it.  He drops the BOTTLE of spirit gum as he looks in
the mirror and sees OLIVIA standing behind him.
ANGIER: (embarrassed)
I thought you'd gone.
Olivia shifts.  Embarrassed.
49.
OLIVIA: I don't really.... have anywhere to
go.
Angier slips the newspaper from the table.
ANGIER: You've been sleeping here?
OLIVIA: Cutter said it would be okay till we
get another booking.
(beat)
What are you doing?
ANGIER: Researching.  Part of a magician's
job is to watch his competition, to
see what illusions they're-
OLIVIA: You're going to do something to that
man, aren't you?
Olivia moves closer.  Angier is quiet.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): Cutter's hopig you'll let things
life.  He says if Borden thinks things
are even between you then we can-
ANGIER: Even?  My wife for a couple of his
fingers?  He has a child now.  And
he's perfoming again.
(bitter)
Borden is out there, living his life
just as he always intended.  As if
nothing had happened.  And look at
me.  I'm alone.  And no theatre will
touch me.
OLIVIA: Us.
Olivia moves towards him.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): You're going to need a better
disguise.
Olivia reaches for Angier's beard.

INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- NIGHT

Angier, almost unrecognizanle as a blonde, slips into the
back of the theatre, which is as rough and unwelcoming as
Borden's last venue.
50.
On the small raised stage, Borden works through his way
through the Chinese rings with GLOVED HANDS to hide his
damaged fingers.  The tough crowd is JEERING AT HIM.
Borden puts the rings down on a table and PICKS UP a bag.
BORDEN: I need a volunteer.
Angier takes a few steps towards the stage.
Borden produces a RUBBER BALL.
he TOSSES the ball to Angier.
BORDEN (CONT'D): As you can see , it's just a rubber
ball.  But it's not normal at all.
Angier examines the ball.  Hands it back to Borden who shows
no sign of recognizing Angier.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Thank you.
Angier notices that two TALL BLACK CABINETS are standing
twenty feet apart on the stage.
BORDEN (CONT'D): (to audience)
You're not impressed?
Borden BOUNCES the BALL on the ground and catches it.
BORDEN (CONT'D): It's a magic ball.
Borden continues to BOUNCE the ball on the floor.  The
audience looks bored, waiting for something to happen.
OLIVIA (V.O.): What happened?

INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT

Angier still in disguise, is slumped in an armchair, drink
in hand.  He is SMILING, remembering.
Olivia, sitting on the workbench, waits for him to continue.
OLIVIA: What happened, Robert?
ANGIER: He had a new trick.
OLIVIA: Was it good?
51.
Angier looks at her...

INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- EVENING

Now it's CUTTER standing in the audience, watching.  Onstage,
Borden BOUNCES the ball over and over again.
ANGIER (V.O.): It was the greatest magic trick I
have ever seen.
Borden walks to one side of the stage and OPENS the door to
one of the cabinets.  It's empty.  He CLOSES it again and
crosses the stage, BOUNCING the ball the whole way.
At the far cabinet, Borden repeats the process, OPENING the
door to the empty cabinet.  This time, however, he leaves
the door open.
He steps forwards and GENTLY BOUNCES the ball SIDEWAYS, across
the stage...
Borden STEPS into the CABINET behind him, CLOSING the door.
With no one on stage, the audience watches as the ball
continues to BOUNCE across the stage.  BOUNCE. BOUNCE.
BOUNCE.  The ball loses seep and height...
Just as reaches the second cabinet, something IMPOSSIBLE
happens.
THE DOOR TO THE SECOND CABINET OPENS AND BORDEN STEPS OUT,
CATCHING THE BALL.: Cutter FLINCHES, then studies Borden.  The audience is
BEMUSED.  Finally, a trickle of applause.

INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

Angier is talking to Cutter.  Olivia is watching.
ANGIER: Did they applaud when you saw it?
CUTTER: Not very enthusiastically.

INT. TINY, GRUBBY THEATRE -- NIGHT

Angier is disguise, starts CLAPPING loudly, FIRMLY, as if he
can't help it, LEADING the applause.
Borden BOUNCES the ball once again, then BOWS deeply.  The
APPLAUSE peters out.  Borden walks off the stage.

INT. ANGIER'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

Angier turns to Cutter.
52.
CUTTER: The trick is too good -- too simple-
the audience harly knows what they've
seen.
ANGIER: He's a dreadful magician.
CUTTER: He's a wonderfull magician- he's a
dreadful showman.  He doesn't know
how to dress it up, how to sell the
trick.
ANGIER: How does he do it?
CUTTER: He uses a double.
ANGIER: (shakes head)
It's not that simple.  This is a
complex illusion.
CUTTER: You think that because you don't
know the method.  It's a double who
comes out at the end.  It's the only
way.
ANGIER: I've seen his perfom ir three times
now, Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is the
same man-
CUTTER: It's not-
ANGIER: The same man comes out of the second
cabinet.  I promise you.
OLIVIA: It is the same man.
They both turn to look at Olivia.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): He wears padded gloves to hide his
damaged fingers, but if you look
closely you can tell.
Angier looks at Cutter.
ANGIER: He doesn't know how to sell his trick
to an audience.  But I do.
53.
CUTTER: (nods)
It would give us our climax.
ANGIER: The man stole my life.  I'm going to
steal his trick.
CUTTER: We'll have to find someone who can
look like you on a stage.
ANGIER: He doesn't use a double-
CUTTER: (impacient)
I don't know how Borden does it,
Robert.  So either you wait for Borden
to retire and buy his secret, or you
can listen to how I would do this
trick.
(Angier nods)
Ang the only way I know is to find
you a bloody good double.
Angier smiles.  Turns to Olivia, pointing to his face.
ANGIER: Take a good look-  let's get out
there and find me.

EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING

Angier, swinging his cane, walks slowly up the mountain road.

EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS

The lab is illuminated by thirty fot STREAMERS of electrical
DISCHARGE that pour from the base of the tower.
Angier stops, fearful.
ALLEY: It's perfectly safe.
As Angier stares, a MAN begins to emerge from the very center
of the CONFLAGRATION.
Bolts SNAP and TRAIL after the man as he walks, in SILHOUETTE,
towards Angier.
54.
TESLA: So this is the Great Danton.
Tesla emerges from the ball of electricity, dressed as if he
were on his way to the opera.  He brushes SPARKS from the
sleeve of his jacket as he extends a band to Angier.
TESLA (CONT'D): Mr. Alley has effused about your act
to me on any number of occasions.
Something you did with pockets?
Angier returns the handshake.
ANGIER: I saw a lecture you gave in London,
several years ago.  I'm flattered
you agreed to see me.
Tesla keeps hold as Angier's hand.
Angier, confused, does so.  Alley hands him a lightbulb,
which starts to glow as he grasps its metal base.
ANGIER (CONT'D): What's conducting the electricity?
TESLA: Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite
capable of conducting, and indeed,
producing energy.
Tesla release Angier's hand. The bulb goes out.  Alley takes
it from the Angier who looks at the palms of his hands.
TESLA (CONT'D): Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

EXT. DECK, LABORATORY -- MORNING

Angier, Alley and Tesla are seated around a table on a decl
overlooking a spectacular view.  They are eating sandwiches.
TESLA: Alley has explained that you require
a very interesting device.
ANGIER: I need something impossible.
TESLA: You're familiar with a phrase 'Man's
reach exceeds his grasp'?
(MORE): 55.
TESLA (CONT'D): (off his look)
It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his
nerve.  The only limits on scientific
progress are these imposed by society.
Tesla looks out at the mountains.
TESLA (CONT'D): The first time I changed the world I
was hailed as a visionary.  The second
time I was asked politely to retire.
The world only tolerates one change
at a time.  And so here I am.
(gestures at laboratory)
Enjoying "retirement".
(looking at Angier)
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.
What you want is simply expensive.
Tesla rises, washing his hands in a basin on a side table.
TESLA (CONT'D): Alley says you are a stage magician.
If a built you this device, you would
be presenting it only as an illusion?
ANGIER: If people thought the things I did
on stage were real, they wouldn't
clap- they'd scream.  Think of saving
a woman in half.
Tesla nods.  Considering.
TESLA: Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine-
ANGIER: Price is not an object.
TESLA: Perhaps not.  But have you considered
the cost?
ANGIER: I'm noit sure I follow.
TESLA: I can make your machine, Mr. Angier.
But I can also give you some advice...
(pointed)
Go home.  Forget this thing.  I can
recognize an obsession.  As Mr. Alley
could tell you, I myself an given to
one now and then.  It will not do
you any good.
56.
ANGIER: Have your obsessions done you no
good?
TESLA: At first.  But I've followed them
too long- I am their slave.  Their
whipping boy. And one day they may
choose to destroy me.
Angier looks into Tesla's eyes.
ANGIER: if you understand an obsession then
you know you won't change my mind.
TESLA: (smiles)
So be it.
ANGIER: Will you build it?
TESLA: I have already begun to build it,
Mr. Angier. I hope you enjoy the
mountain air.  This will take time.
Tesla disappears into the lab.

INT. GREEN ROOM DRINKING CLUB -- EVENING

The club is warm and dark. Olivia, Cutter and Angier make
their way to the bar.  Olivia points to the far end of the
bar, to a TRAMP in tattered clothing, curled over a pint.
OLIVIA: (to tramp)
Gerry?
The tramp sees Olivia, hoists himself up and spills his way
down the bar to them.  As he draws closer, we understand why
Olivia has brought them here.
Underneath the filth and matted hair, this man is SPITTING
IMAGE of Robert Angier- HE IS PLAYED BY THE SAME ACTOR
OLIVIA (CONT'D): Mr. Angier, Mr. Cutter, I would like
you  to meet Mr. Gerald Root.
ROOT: A pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.
Angier is staring a little too much.  Root throws an ARM
over Angier's shoulder and draws him in.
57.
ROOT (CONT'D): (whisper)
Would you like for me to tell you a
little joke?
Angier smiles unconfortably.  Sunddely Root WRAPS this hands
around Angier's neck and begins to THROTTLE him.
Cutter breaks it up and pushes Root back.
ROOT (CONT'D): (yelling)
Are you laughing?
Angier is shaken.  Root picks up his hat off the bar and
disappears onto the street.
ANGIER: He's out of his mind.
OLIVIA: He's an out-of-work actor- of course
he's out of his mind.
CUTTER: He's perfect.  A little work, mind
you, but when I'm done with him he
could be your brother.
ANGIER: I don't need him to be my brother.
I need him to be me.

EXT. NORTH HILL -- DAY

Borden escorts Sarah and their TODDLER, a girl, up the three
lined street.
Borden stops abruptly.  Crouches to his daugther.
BORDEN: Would you like to see a magic trick?
Borden reaches up and pushes a wayward LOCK a her hair over
her ear.  When his hands returns, it's holding a KEY.
He stands, places the key in Sarah's hand.
SARAH: What is this for?
Borden takes her gently by the shoulders and turns her around
until she's facing a modest two-story HOUSE.  She looks down
at the key in her hand.
58.
SARAH (CONT'D): When I asked last week you said we
couldn't afford.
BORDEN: You caught me in the wrong mood.
SARAH: But you want through all the-
BORDEN: Sarah,  I'm allowed to change my
mind, aren't I? The act is taking
off, maybe soon I'll get us into a
bigger theatre.  Things will work.
Sarah turns and embraces her husband.

INT. EMPIRE THEATRE

The auditoruim is empty.  Two doors is simple frames have
been erected in the middle of the stage.  Angier fiddles
with one, opening it, walking through it.  Olivia is watching.
OLIVIA: You walk through this one- then...?
Angier stands Olivia in front of the door.
he pushes the door all way open.  Suddenly, a TRAP-DOOR set
into the floor POPS open. Angier JUMPS through it-

INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS

Olivia gathers up her skirts and DROPS through the hole-

INT. BENEATH THE EMPIRE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

-LANDING beside Angier on the straw matterss.
OLIVIA: Oof.  Couldn't you find a softer
one?
ANGIER: (smiles)
It's not for sleeping on.
Olivia looks around the below stage area.
OLIVIA: And Root goes up through there?
59.
She gestures  at a LIFT twenty feet away with a TRAP DOOR
MECHANISM above it.  Angier nods.  Olivia looks at Angier.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): It's going to be amazing, Robert.
ANGIER: It has to be.  Borden's trick is
getting noticed.  The place was packed
today.
Olivia looks at him strangely.
OLIVIA: You went and saw his show again?
Angier looks away, embarrassed.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): You becoming obsessed, Robert.
CUTTER (O.S.): Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Robert.
Angier and Olivia look up to see Cutter at the trap door.

INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- MOMENTS LATER

Angier and Olivia sit in the front row.  Cutter beckons Root
onstage.  He's been clened up and dressed in Angier's stage
costume.  he TRIPS on his way across the stage.
ANGIER: All I have to do is keep myself
stinking drunk all the time and no
one will be able to tell the
difference.
CUTTER: A little faith, sir.  Could you favor
us with a perfomance. Mr. Root?
Root picks himself up and dusts himself off.
Suddenly, ROOT HAS BECOME ANGIER.  he is channeling everything
from his facial expressions to his walk.  Angier nods,
starting to believe this might work.  The illusion is PERFECT --
till he opens his mouth.
ROOT: You would drink, too, if you know
the world half so well as I do.
Angier hops up onto stage, examining Root from different
angles.  Root starts APING his every movement.  Olivia starts
laughing.  Angier is getting uncomfortable.
60.
ROOT (CONT'D): Did you think you were unique, Mr.
Angier?  I have been Cassar.  I have
been Faust.  How difficult could it
possibly be to play 'The Great
Danton?'
CUTTER: You can go back to being yourself.
Root.  For free..
Root looks challengingly at both men.
ROOT: I'd rather be him, for now.  I find
it amusing.
Root WAVES his hands across his chest, in the same manner
that Angier does onstage.  He produces a bottle of Gin from
thin air, and takes a long swallow and jumps down to Olivia.
CUTTER: Root has to keep a low profile--
anyone sees him the game's up.
ANGIER: (watching Root)
I don't know how you do these things,
Cutter.  I'm not sure I want to know.
CUTTER: Have you thought about what we should
call the trick?
ANGIER: No point being coy.  Borden calls
his trick 'The Transported Man'?
Cutter nods.

EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE -- EVENING

The enormous MARQUEE of the Empire Theatre: 'The Great Danton perfoms THE NEW TRANSPORTED MAN'
Beneath it, a CROWD.  Fallon amongest them.  STARING up at
the sign.

INT. EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING

Angier is onstage, nearing the end of his show, SMILING
BROADLY as he pulls dozens of FLOWERS from thin air and tosses
them to the crowd.  APPLAUSE fills the theatre.
The DOORFRAMES are wheeld out on either side of the stage.
Angier approaches the edge of the stage to address the
audience with a suddenly SOLEMN demeanor.
61.
ANGIER: Ladies and gentlemen, much of what
you've seen tonight can be termed
illusions.  Entertaining trifles of
the sort you may have seen other
magicians perform.
Angier puts on a TOP HAT.
ANGIER (CONT'D): Alas, I cannot claim this next feat
as illusion.  Watch carefully- you
will see no trickery, for no trickery
is being employed. Merely a techique
familiar to certain citizens of the
orient and various holy men of the
Himalyas.  Indeed, some of you may
be familiar with this technique, but
for those of you who aren't, do not
be alarmed, what you are about to
see is considered safe...
Angier gracefully TURNS and heads upstage to the right-hand
door, opens it, SLAPS it to show that is sold.
Then strolls through crossing the stage-
-to the other door, which he opens, SLAPPING to show its
solidity, then walking trough the frame.
Angier removes his TOP HAT and THROWS it high into the air.
It sails back down to him and he catches it.
Angier THROWS the HAT again, even harder this time, and it
disappears uo into the rafters.  After a beat, it is clear
it's not coming back down.
LAUGHTER.  Angier snaps his fingers and the hat is dropped
back down to him.  He catches it.
Angier movies to the first door and THROWS HIS HAT in a HIGH
ARC across the stage.  He OPENS the door- steps behind it...
The second DOOR, FAR ACROSS THE STAGE, IMMEDIATELY opens and
ANGIER/ROOT EMERGES, REACHING UP TO CATCH THE HAT.
BOTH DOORS SLAMS SHUT behind him.  He puts on the hat.
The AUDIENCE ERUPTS- A STANDING OVATION, Fallon the only one
in his seat as Angier/Root takes his BOWS.

INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Angier, hearing the MASSIVE APPLAUSE, climbs off the straw
mattress, PEERING up through the cracks in the floorboards.
Smiling, Angier turns to the unseen audience and BOWS.
62.

INT. DRESSING ROOM -- EVENING

Angier, Olivia, and Cutter are CELEBRATING their sucess.
Empty bottles of champagne line the makeup table.
OLIVIA: (toast)
To our achivement.
They drink.
CUTTER: The manager said he's never seen a
reaction like it.
Angier smiles, rueful.
ANGIER: At least he got to see it.  I spent
the ovation hidden under the stage.
No one cares about the man who
disappears, the man who goes into
the box.  They care about the man
who comes out the other side.
OLIVIA: I care about the man in the box.
Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass.
ANGIER: Thank you.
(to Cutter)
Maybe we could switch before the
trick.  That way I could be the
Prestige and Root ends up below stage.
CUTTER: (shakes head)
The antecipation of the trick is
everything- it needs your showmanship
to built suspense.  If Root opens
his mouth, it's all over- he can't
introduce the trick.
ROOT (O.S.): of course I can.  I'm the Great
Danton.
They turn.  Root is lying behind a trunk, still in costume.
CUTTER: Root, you bloody fool, get that
costume and makeup off right now,
anyone could walk in here!
Cutter is SLAPPING Root to his feet.  He grabs his collar
and turns to Angier and Olivia.
63.
CUTTER (CONT'D): Congratulation, all.
Cutter DRAGS Root out.  Olivia slides onto the makeup table.
ANGIER: I suppose I should get more rest.
OLIVIA: Life is not full of these moments,
Robbie.
Olivia pours him some more champagne.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): We've worked hard for this, and we
need to celebrate properly.
Angier looks up at her with a gentle smile.  She pulls him
in closer and they KISS.  She wraps her legs around him.
They kiss again.
Angier pulls back.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): What's wrong?
(softly)
It is your wife?
Angier shakes his head, distracted.
ANGIER: The trick isn't good enough.
Olivia stares at him.
OLIVIA: Didn't you see the audience?
ANGIER: No.
OLIVIA: Well, they loved it.
ANGIER: It's not as good as his trick.
OLIVIA: Borden's trick is nothing compared
to ours.  He doesn't have any style-
ANGIER: He doesn't have to spend the finale
hiding under the stage.
Angier rises, turning out of her embrace.
64.
ANGIER (CONT'D): I need to know how he does it.
OLIVIA: Why?
ANGIER: So that I can do it better.
Angier turns to her.  Looks her in the eye.
ANGIER (CONT'D): I need you to go and work for him.
OLIVIA: Work for him?  Are you joking
ANGIER: You'll be my spy.
OLIVIA: (taken aback)
We just got our start and you want
me to leave?
ANGIER: It's how we advance.
Angier moves to Olivia, placing his hands on her shoulders.
ANGIER (CONT'D): Think of it, Olivia... we've got
people excited about Cutter's version
of the trick- imagine what we could
do with the real illusion. We'll
have the greatest magic act anyone's
ever seen.
OLIVIA: (frustated)
He knows I work for you.
ANGIER: Exactly why he'll want to hire you.
He'll want my secrets.
OLIVIA: Why would he trust me?
Angier thinks for a second.  Then smiles.
ANGIER: Because you're going to tell him the
truth.

INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY

Alley shows Angier in.  Tesla is sitting, reading.
65.
TESLA: You must be curious to see what so
much money had bought you, Mr. Angier.
Tesla RISES.  Leads Angier to a back corner at the room and
pulls a SHEET from a ten-foot tall apparatus- the ELECTRICAL
MACHINE Angier used on stage in the opening of the film.
TESLA (CONT'D): Fitting that you should be here for
the maiden voyage.
Alley FIRES a GENERATOR connected by thick cables to the
machine. It RUMBLES into life, smoke pouring from the slats.
TESLA (CONT'D): Your hat.
Angier takes off his hat and tries to hand it to Tesla.
Alley intercepts the hat and lays it on a chalk hasmark
directly underneath the machine.  He returns to the controls.
ALLEY: You might want to stand back.
TESLA: No, no.  It will be fine.  Mr. Alley,
please proceed.
Without further ceremony, Alley FIRES the machine.
Nothing happens.  Then, as they watch, the GLOBE on top of
the tripped FLASHES whits hot.  BOLTS shooting out of it,
wrapping themselves around the legs of the tripod.  The CHARGE
reaches a FREEZY and then emits a loud BANG, as if it has
broken the sound barrier.
Suddenly the room is still.
Tesla walks forward.  Looks down into the pit.
Alley joins him at the edge of the pit.  Angier,  limping,
is the last to arrive, locking into the pit-
-at the TOP HAT, which hasn't moved an inch.
ANGIER: I don't understand-
Tesla STARES at the hat as if trying to melt it with
CONCENTRARION.  Alley pulls Angier away from the pit.
ALLEY: Perhaps it would be best if you left
us to it.  We'll see you next week?
Angier begins to protest but Alley gestures towards the door.
66.

INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

A small, disused shop off an arcade, crowed with tools,
cabinetry and props, windows plastered with playbills.  Borden
is sitting at a workbench, sleeves rolled up, working a lathe.
Fallon enters, Olivia behind him.  Borden looks back at her,
turns back to the table, instinctively putting on his gloves.
OLIVIA: (looking around)
Interesting workshop.
BORDEN: We make do.
OLIVIA: My name is Olivia Wenscombe.
BORDEN: I know who you are.  Are you here to
steal the rest of my show?
Olivia sees one of the theatrical notices that litter the
shop: "THE GREAT DANTON BREAKS RECORD WITH HIS ASTONISHING
NEW TRICK":
OLIVIA: No.  I'm here to give your show what
is missing.
BORDEN: And what might that be?
OLIVIA: Me.
BORDEN: (to Fallon)
Wasn't I just saying that, Bernard?
A woman's touch.
Fallon leaves, closing the door.
OLIVIA: I've left Angier.  I want a job.
Borden sits there.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): I know you have no reason to trust
me-
BORDEN: Why on earth shouldn't I trust you?
The mistress of my enemy.
Olivia is taken aback.  Chanes tack.
67.
OLIVIA: Mr.Borden-
BORDEN: Alfred.
OLIVIA: Alfred.  I'm going to tell you the
truth.
BORDEN: Ah.  The truth.  A slippery notion
in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe.
OLIVIA: I'm here because he sent me here.
He wants me to come and work for you
and steal your secret.
BORDEN: What does he need my secret for?
His trick is top notch.  The Great
Danton vanishes and isntantly
reappears on the other side of the
stage --  mute, overweight, and,
unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk.
Borden rises, moves closer to Olivia.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Tell me, Olivia.  Does he like taking
his bows under the stage?
Olivia meets his gaze.
OLIVIA: No.  It's killing him.  he's obsessed
with discovering your method.  He
thinks of nothing else, and takes no
pleasure in our sucess.  I've had
enough.  There's no future with him.
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you
his.
BORDEN: He has no secrets from me.
Borden stares at her, unsure.
BORDEN (CONT'D): And this is the truth?
She gives Borden a challenging smile/shrug.
68.

INT. BACKSTAGE -- DAY

Cutter is fixing a prop mechanism.  Angier approaches, in
his undershirt, looks over his shoulder.  Cutter glances up.
CUTTER: Best be getting changed for the
martinee, sir.
- Angier nods.  Cutter REALIZES.
CUTTER (CONT'D): ROOT!  You're late.
(sniffs)
And even more drunk than usual.  Get
yourself below stairs, right away!
ROOT: No.
CUTTER: No?!
Root looks at Cutter with genuine malice.
ROOT: We need to have a chat, Mr.Cutter.

INT. DRESSING ROOM -- DAY

Angier is applying his makeup.  Cutter enters.  Angier looks
at him through the mirror.
ANGIER: We have a problem, Cutter.
He holds up the paper, folded to an advertisement: PANTAGES THEATRE- FROM NEXT WEEK- THE PROFESSOR WILL
DEMONSTRATE THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED MAN- ACCEPT NO CHEAP
IMITATIONS!!!:
ANGIER (CONT'D): He'll be perfoming right across the
street.
CUTTER: We have a bigger problem.  Root.
ANGIER: Don't tell me he fell over again.
CUTTER: Worse.  He realized he can make
demands.
ANGIER: He's blackmailing us?
69.
CUTTER: In a word, yes.  I'm surprised, to
be honest- it usually takes them a
lot longer to figure it out.
ANGIER: How much does he want?
CUTTER: It makes no difference- we have to
stop doing the trick.
ANGIER: (wields paper)
Stop doing the trick?  Look at this.
CUTTER: Look at yesterday's.  And last week's,
where they called you "London's
premiere stage performer", not
"magician" mind.  Performer.  Of any
kind.
ANGIER: What's the point?
CUTTER: My point, Robert, is that you've
climbed too high to get away with
any kind of professional
embarrassament.  We're not doing any
tricks we can't control.
Angier considers this.  Nods.  Thinking.
ANGIER: Pay him whatever he wants, for now.
We keep doing the trick till Borden
opens, then we'll phase it out.

INT. BENEATH THE EMPIRE STAGE -- NIGHT

Root smokes a cigarette.  PULL BACK to reveal he is standing
on the LIFT beneath the stage...
The trapdoor OPENS and Angier DROPS onto the straw mattress.
He looks over to see Root finishing his cigarette.
ANGIER: (hisses)
Get up there!!
Root smirks at Angier- TOSSES the cigarette and CATAPULTS up-

INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS

-onto the stage and STEPS/STUMBLES out from behind the door
to LOUD APPLAUSE.
70.
Root has a SLOPPY GRIN as he STRUTS acroos the stage, milking
the applause from every angle, blowing kisses, winking...
loving it.  He turns to Cutter in the wings.  Blows him a
kiss.
Cutter GLARES.  Then TURNS to a stagehand.
CUTTER: Get it down!
ANGIER (V.O.): Cutter was always surprised how fast
Root turned bad.
The stagehand starts LOWERING THE CURTAIN.

INT. RESTAURANT, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- DAY

Angier sits with Borden's dairy.
ANGIER (V.O.): We paid him enough to keep him in
beer- you wouldn't expect him to
rock the boat.  Today I learned
Borden's view on the episode...

INT. TAVERN -- EVENING

The bar is dark and seedy, packed with an unpromising lot.
ANGIER (V.O.): ...and his account suggests a reason.
Root is hanging precariously from his barstool, head lolling
towards his empty glass.  He is in his own clothes, but
cleaned up to look like Angier.
A full PINT arrives in front of him.  Root turns to face his
benefactor- BORDEN.  Root takes several large GULPS, staring
at Borden.  Suppresses a belch.
ROOT: To what do I owe the pleasure of
this rather welcome pint of ale?
BORDEN: You are the Great Danton, aren't
you?
Root gestures silence, glancing around them.
ROOT: Of course I am.  But don't advertise
it- I'll be mobbed with fans.
(grins at Borden)
And who might you be?
71.
BORDEN: Just a humble admirer.  And fellow
practitioner.
ROOT: Ah, very good.
Root DOWNS the rest of his new pint, placing the empty glass
in front of Borden with an emphatic THUNK.
BORDEN: Another?
ROOT: If you insist.  I'm not perfoming
tonight.  Well, only one show, and,
to be frank, my people pretty much
run things these days.
BORDEN: You could probably do it blindfolded.
ROOT: Bloody good idea.
BORDEN: Have it.
ROOT: Thanks.
A new pint arrives.  Root sips.
BORDEN: Actually, there's something I might
warn you about.
ROOT: Oh?
BORDEN: Well, it's your Transported Man
illusion.  Now, I'm noit claiming to
know your method... but I had a
similar trick in my act- and I used...
(looks around,
whispering)
...a double.
ROOT: Oh, I see, very good.
BORDEN: At first.  Then it went bad.  You
se,  I hadn't counted on the fact
that once I incorporated this bloke
into my act, he had complete power
over me.
72.
ROOT: Complete power, you say?
BORDEN: (nodding gravely)
Weel, he was the secret, you see.
And the more successful I became,
the more outrageous his demands
became.  He practically backrupted
me.  In the end I had to stop
performing the illusion completely.
(looks at Root)
You must be very careful about giving
someone that power over you.
Root looks at Borden.  Drunken whells spinning.
ROOT: Thanks for the warning.

INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING

Angier is almost all the way through his act.
ANGIER: ...some of you may be familiar with
this technique, but for those of you
who aren't, do not be alarmed, what
you are about to see is considered
safe...
Angier takes his time, confident, MILKING IT.  He throws his
HAT into the air, catches it.

INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Angier DROPS ten feet to the concrete floor.  But there is
NOTHING to break his fall-
He SMASHES painfully to the ground.  CLUTCHING his leg in
AGONY, he looks up and sees SOMEONE standing on the lift
twenty feet away... BORDEN.

INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

The first door slams shut.  The audience turns their attention
to second door.
The door remains closed.  The HAT falls  gently to the floor.
SILENCE, broken by a COUGH in the audience.

INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

BORDEN bows to Angier- the LIFT ROCKETS BORDEN UP THROUGH
THE STAGE FLOOR.: 73.

INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

The second door OPENS, and BORDEN steps through, looking all
around, CONFUSED, as if he doesn't know where he is.  He
looks back at the door, then picks up the HAT...

INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Angier looks at his leg- a nasty COMPOUND FRACTURE.  As he
chokes on pain he can hear LAUGHTER from the AUDIENCE.

INT. STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

As Borden mugs with the hat, trying it on and finding it too
small, something is LOWERED from the flies above: ANGIER/ROOT, BOUND AND GAGGED, HANGS from a chain.  A sign
around his neck reads: "OPENING AT PANTAGE- THE PROFESSOR"
Borden looks up behind him.
BORDEN: Great Danton, I must apologize!  I
simply had too much magic for my
stage at the Pantages!
The Great Danton comes to rest three feet above the stage.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Pardon my intrusion!
Borden places the top hat and ANGIER/ROOT at a JAUNTY ANGLE.
THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER.  Borden BOWS, hops down
off the stage, and walks up the aisle, bowing, enjoying it
all the way.

INT. STAGE -- LATER

Cutter crouches over Angier, fixing a LONG SPLINT to his
broken leg.  Behind them, Root still hangs above the stage,
groaning in protest.
CUTTER: I don't see how Borden found him- I
had him under wraps, I was careful.
ANGIER: Well, he did.
Cutter helps Angier to his feet.
CUTTER: Sit, do you think it might be her?
Olivia?
Angier stops to look at Cutter.
74.
ANGIER: No.  I don't.
Cutter gestures at Root.
CUTTER: Shall we cut him down?
ANGIER: He's the Great Danton.  Let him cut
himself down.

EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT

Angier, thinly disguised, leg in long metal brace, pushes
through the crowd outside the box office.  The marquee: The
Professor Performs His Masterpiece- THE ORIGINAL TRANSPORTED
MAN!!: On the box office: SOLD OUT THRU SUNDAY.  Angier STARES.
SCALPER (O.S.): Need tickets, sir?
Angier turns to the SCALPER.  Nods.

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING

Angier slumps into a seat at the back of the PACKED theatre.
ONSTAGE: Borden works through his show with a SUPERIOR DEGREE
OF SHOWMANSHIP, even cracking a smile when called for.
Working WITHOUT GLOVES, he makes much of performing tricks
ONE-HANDED.  He is assisted by Olivia, who looks STUNNING.
Borden performs ths Transported Man.  Borden HAS DRESSED IT
UP WITH ELECTRICAL APPARATUS.  Two large glass balls transmit
SPARKS between one cabinet and the other along BARE WIRES.
Another watches,  anger rising as he watches Olivia's close
RAPPORT with Borden.

INT. APARTAMENT -- EVENING

Olivia enters in to the darkness bedroom.  She strikes a
match and lights one of the gaslights...
...and SCREAMS as the gaslight illuminates Angier, sitting
in an armchair, cane leaning against the arm of the chair.
ANGIER: You weren't expecting me?
OLIVIA: I was expecting you sooner, Robbie.
Your message said "afternoon".
75.
ANGIER: Well, it takes a bit for me to get
around these days...
Angier RAPS his leg brace with his cane.  HOISTS himself up.
ANGIER (CONT'D): He's taken everything from me.  My
wife, my career...  now you.
OLIVIA: What do you mean?  You sent me to-
Angier takes her by the shoulders, ROUGHLY.
ANGIER: I sent you to steal his secret- not
to improve his act-
OLIVIA: That's my job-!
ANGIER: Or to fall in love with him!
OLIVIA: You abandoned me to him!
Angier SLAPS her.  She shakes her head at him.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): I did everything you asked.
ANGIER: (challenging)
Yes?  Then how does he do it?!
OLIVIA: Cutter was right- it's a double.
Angier shakes his head, furious.
ANGIER: Of course Borden said that-
OLIVIA: He didn't say anything- he'd never
say.  I've seen things- make-up,
glasses, wigs.  We don't use any of
it for the show, but I've found it
hidden backstage.
ANGIER: (scorn)
It's misdirection- he leaves those
things lying around to make you think
he's using a double.
76.
OLIVIA: All the time?   He doesn't know when
I'm looking-
ANGIER: All the time, Olivia- that's who he
is, that's what it takes- he lives
his act, don't you see?!
(beat)
And just because you're sleeping
with him doesn't mean he trusts you.
Olivia glares athim,  tears forming in her eyes.
OLIVIA: You thing you can see everything,
don't you?
She moves to her bed, REACHING below the mattress.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): But the Great Danton, is a blind
fool.
Olivia tosses something at Angier: a CARDBOARD-BOUND NOTEBOOK.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): His notebook.
Angier starts leafing desperately through pages.
ANGIER: You stole it?
OLIVIA: I borrowed it for tonight.  I thought
you'd be able to translate some of
it, but now I realize-
ANGIER: I can't.
OLIVIA: (scorn)
You can't.
ANGIER: Olivia, no one could-
(studies pages)
It's a cypher- with a transposition
that probably shifts every day of
the diary.  Even with the keyword it
would take months to decode...
OLIVIA: And without the keyword?
77.
ANGIER: Perhaps never.  We'll see.
Angier puts the cardboard-bound notebook into his pocket.
Olivia, worried, holds out her hand for the notebook.
OLIVIA: No, we won't- if I don't get that
back tomorrow morning, he'll know I
took it.
Angier looks at her, incredulous.
ANGIER: You can'r possibly think I'd let
this go?  This is his diary, Olivia.
All of his secrets are right here,
in my hands.
OLIVIA: (pleading)
Don't do this do me, Robert!
ANGIER: (shrugs)
Leave him.
OLIVIA: He knows where I live!
ANGIER: I need to know his method.
OLIVIA: (desperate)
It won't get your wife back, Robert.
ANGIER: I don't care about my wife- I care
about his secret!
Angier stops, realizing what he said.  Calms himself.
ANGIER (CONT'D): Look, I'll go to his workshop and
stage a break-in-
OLIVIA: He'll know it was you-
Angier puts his hands GENTLY on her shoulders.
ANGIER: Yes, me, not you.  Understand?
Olivia nods, crying.  Still scared.  Angier drags his leg to
the door.  She watches him go, torn.
78.
OLIVIA: Robert?  I have fallen in love with
him.
Angier looks at her, sympathetic.
ANGIER: Then I know how hard this had been
hard for you.

INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

CLOSE ON: SHATTERED GLASS, BROKEN PROPS AND CABINETRY.
Borden and Fallon survey the WRECKAGE of their shop.  Borden
looks at Fallon.
BORDEN: Notebook.
Fallon nods.  Borden sighs.  Weary.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Then he's just getting started.

EXT. STAGEDOOR, PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING

A small CROWD of autograph SEEKERS crowd the stagedoor.  A
BODYGUARD steps through the door and begins unshering them
away as Fallon and Borden follow him through the door.
The bodyguard hold the door to a carriage open and Fallon
steps up.  Borden stops at the door.
BORDEN: I'm walking tonight, gentlemen.
Fallon looks concerned.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Let him come.  I don't care.
Borden doffs his hat and walks onto the crowd street.
Fallon steps down, reaches into the bodyguard's jacket and
pulls out a PISTOL.  He checks that it's loaded and slips it
into his own jacket.  Then he sets off after Borden.

EXT. STREETS, WEST END -- EVENING

Fallon continues to follow Borden at a distance.  Borden
steps into a tobacconist's.  Fallon stops and idles at the
street corner.
As Fallon watches, acrooss the street, another man STOPS.
Fallon slips back around the corner and looks: It's Angier, leaning on his cane.
79.
Borden emerges from the tobacconist and continues down the
street, a cloud of pipe smoke drifting after him.
Fallon waits for Angier to set off after Borden, then follows
both men from a distance.
Borden crosses to the same side of the street as Angier.
Fallon picks up his pace and tries to cross the street but
is HELD UP for a second by passing traffi.
As he reaches the other side, Borden is gone, but he sees
Angier dissappear down and alleyway.

EXT. ALLEY -- CONTINUOUS

Fallon rounds the cornder and stops.  The alleyway is EMPTY.  --
he has lost them.  Finally, he sees an open, darkned doorway
towards the end of the alleyway.

INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Fallon stops at the doorway, his gloved hand gripping te
doorframe.
Angier stands at the other end of the hallway, watching him.
Fallon takes a step towards him and CRASHES through the rotten
floor to the basement below.

INT. BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Fallon drops heavily into an almost-vertical OPEN COFFIN.
DISORIENTED, Fallon just glimpses CUTTER DROP THE LID INTO
PLACE, shutting him in.  Cutter starts NAILING it down.
A GUNSHOT TEARS through the lid of the box.  Cutter falls
back, but is caught by Angier.
Angier rolls Cutter off to one side.  He is clutching at a
BLOODY WOUND on his arm.
CUTTER: I'll live.
(to coffin)
You save me the trouble to making
you an air hole!
Angie picks up the hammer and continues NAILING.

EXT. HIGHGATE CEMETARY -- MORNING

Borden picks up his way through the overgrown cemetary.  He
hears a KNOCKING and turns: Angier is behind him, RAPPING on a broken headstone with the
head of his cane.
80.
BORDEN: I'm impressed.
ANGIER: Why's that?
BORDEN: You're finally getting your hands
dirty.  This is what a good trick
costs, Angier.  Risk.  Sacrifice.
ANGIER: The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all
going to be yours.  Unless you give
me what I want.
BORDEN: Which is?
ANGIER: Your secret.
Borden tries to gauge Angier's expression.
BORDEN: My secret?
ANGIER: Your method for the Transported Man.
Fallon wouldn't tell me.  In fact,
he doesn't talk at all.
BORDEN: (shrugs)
You have my notebook.
ANGIER: Useless without the keyword.
Angier pulls a sheaf of writing paper and a pencil stub from
his pocket.  He offers them to Borden.
ANGIER (CONT'D): Write down your method Mr. Borden.
Describe it in full.
Borden takes the paper and pencil and stares Angier in the
eye, gauging him.
Beat.
Borden writes a SINGLE WORD on the top page and folds it up.
ANGIER (CONT'D): I want the method not the keyword- I
don't even know if the secret is in
you notebook.
81.
Borden looks at Angier with a glint in his eye.
BORDEN: The keyword is the method.
Angier reaches for the folded paper, which Borden lifts out
of reach.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Where is my ingeneur?
Angier pulls a SHOVEL free from a pile of dirt beside him.
He STAKES it into a fresh pile of dirt in front of Borden.
Borden looks at Angier, CONCERNED.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Is he
Angier plucks the folded paper from Borden's hand.
ANGIER: How fast can you gid?
Angier movies away through the headstone, leaning heavily on
his cane.  Borden begins to DIG.

INT. HOSPITAL -- EVENING

Cutter is slumped in a chair by the wall, his arm bandaged.
He smiles up at Angier, who sits down next to him.
ANGIER: How's the arm?
CUTTER: Still attached.  Did you get your
answer?
Angier holds up the folded paper.
ANGIER: Our answer, Cutter.  I haven't looked
yet,  I wanted you to share this.
Cutter looks curiously at Angier.
CUTTER: I already know how he does it, Robert.
The same way he always has, the same
way we do.  You just want it to be
something more.
Angier looks at Cutter, uneasy.
ANGIER: Well, let's find out, shall we?
82.
Angier opens the piece of paper.  A large GRIN spreads across
his face.  he turns it to Cutter- it reads-
- T E S L A -
Cutter frowns, confused.
CUTTER: What does it mean?
ANGIER: (excited)
It means, Cutter, that we have a
journey ahead of us.  To America.
Cutter watches Angier's excitement.  Awkward.
CUTTER: Robert, listen to me.
(gentle, but definite)
Obssession is a young man's game, I
can't follow you any farther in this.
Angier looks at Cutter, uncomprehending.  He considers saying
something.  Stops.  Restraining himself.
ANGIER: Then the rest is up to me.

INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT -- EVENING

Sarah sits by herself at a table for two.  Borden ENTERS
with a swagger, Olivia beside him, Fallon behind.  The MAITRE
D' hurries over, signaling WAITERS.  Sarah looks up.
UNCOMFORTABLE.:
SARAH: I didn't know we'd be joined for
dinner.
BORDEN: Absolutely.  We're celebrating.
The Waiters spirit another table and chairs to join Sarah's.
Borden pulls out a chair for Olivia.
SARAH: Miss Wenscombe.  Mr.Fallon.
Olivia smiles cheerfully.  Fallon nods, embarrassed.
BORDEN: (to wine waiter)
Champagne.  Your finest
SARAH: What are we celebrating, dear?
83.
BORDEN: Well, we've hit upon a new trick,
haven't we, Fallon?
OLIVIA: What trick, Freddy?
SARAH: (brittle)
Yes, "Freddy".  What trick?
The WAITER presents a bottle of champagne.  Borden nods
without looking at it.
BORDEN: (loud)
I'm going to bury myself alive.
Every night.  Then someone's going
to come along and dig me up!
OTHER DINERS are glancing over.  The waiter uncorks the bottle
with a muffled POP and pours champagne into Borden's glass.
SARAH: (to waiter)
I'm not sure my husband needs-
BORDEN: Who are you to tell me what?!
Awkward silence.  Olivia shifts in her seat.
OLIVIA: Perhaps-
SARAH: Perhaps, Mr.Fallon, you might escort
Miss Wenscombe home.  My husband's
being a bore.  I see no reason for
the two of you to suffer as well.
Fallon is on his feet, pulling back Olivia's chair.
OLIVIA: Good-night, Mrs.Borden.  Good-night,
Freddy.
They leave.  Borden glares at his wife.
SARAH: "Freddy"?
BORDEN: It's my name.
SARAH: Not at home.
84.
BORDEN: I'm not always at home.
Sarah is clearly on the verge of tears.
SARAH: Alfred, why are you being like this?
Borden, seeing her fistress, softnes.
BORDEN: Sarah, I had a terrible ordeal today.
I thought I'd lost something very
precious to me.
SARAH: What?
Borden looks at her speechless.  Shrugs helplessly.
SARAH (CONT'D): I see.  More secrets.
BORDEN: Secrets are my life, Sarah.  Our
life.
Sarah brushes away a tear.
SARAH: When you're like this, Alfred, I'm
not seeing the real you.  You're
treating me like your audience.
Performing.  I can't live with that.
Borden just sits there.  Offering nothing.

EXT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- DAY

Angier walks up to the hotel.  A MOTORCAR is parked in front
and TWO MEN are unloading it.  One of the men STARES at Angier
as he enters the hotel.

INT. CLIFF HOUSE INN

Angier walks to the reception desk.
ANGIER: I thought I had the place to myself.
MANAGER: Unexpected guests.
(looks out the window
at the men)
Not very polite.  A lot of questions.
At first I thought they might work
for the government.
85.
ANGIER: No?
MANAGER: (lowers voice)
Worse.  They work for Thomas Edison.
Angier starts out the windo at the men unloading equipment.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- CONTINUOUS

Angier sits at the desk, deciphering Borden's diary.
BORDEN (V.O.): Today, a most curious development...

INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

Borden turns to see Fallon show in Olivia.
BORDEN (V.O.): His assistent come to us with a
proposition...
They start to speak as Borden's V.O. continues.
BORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D): Obviously Angier has sent her, and
told her to admit as much...
BORDEN (CONT'D): Tell me Olivia.  Does he like taking
his bows under the stage?
Olivia meets his gaze.
OLIVIA: No.  It's killing him.  He's obssessed
with discovering your method.  he
thinks of nothing else, and takes no
pleasure in our success.  I've had
enough.  There is no future with
him.  He sent me here to steal your
secrets, but I've actually come to
offer you his.
BORDEN: He has no secrets from me.
Borden stares at her, unsure.
BORDEN (CONT'D): This is the "truth" you spoke of?
She gives him a sly smile.
86.
OLIVIA: No. This is what he told me to tell
you.
Beat.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): The truth is that I loved him.  And
stood by him.  And he sent me to you
like he'd send a stagehand to pick
up his shirts.
(looks him in the eye)
I hate him for that.
They sit there in silence, appraising each other.
BORDEN: I can spot Angier's methods from the
back of the theatre.  What could you
possibly have to offer me?
Olivia smiles, moves to Borden, reaching for his gloved hand.
Borden flinches, surprised.
OLIVIA: You may know he does his tricks...
but you can't understand why no one
can see that yours are better.
She tenderly PEELS OFF his padded glove revealing his
mutiladed hand.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): You hide this.  I had to look closely
to spot it when you performed the
Transported Man.
(looks into his eyes)
But this makes you unique... it shows
the audience that you aren't using a
double;  You musn't hide it, you
must display it proudly...
(looks at hand)
I'm sure it takes great skill to
perform illusions with one good hand.
BORDEN: (quietly)
It does.
OLIVIA: Then let people know.  You can be so
much more then he is.  I can show
you how.
Borden looks into her eyes.
BORDEN (V.O.): I think she is telling the truth.
87.

INT. BEDROOM, BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT

Borden and Olivia are in bed together.  It is raining outside.
He watching her get out of bed and moves to the window to
smoke a cigarette.
BORDEN (V.O.): I think we cannot trust her.  But I
love her.  I need her.  We need her.
BORDEN (CONT'D): How could he send you away?  He must
be blind, deaf and dumb.
She smiles quietly at this.
OLIVIA: Robbie's blinded by his jealosy.
He'd do anything for you secret.
Sending me away was the least of it.
Borden considers this.
BORDEN (V.O.): Trust is not the point- love is the
point... who have we ever trusted?
To open myself to such a relationship,

EXT. NARROW ALLEYWAY -- DAY

Olivia makes her way past crowed MARKET STALLS.
BORDEN (V.O.): ...to the dangers of such an affair...
I need assurances of fidelity.  Of
love.
Fallon is SHADOWING her from a distance.
BORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D): But how to be sure when truth is
layered like the skin of an onion?
I know a way... she must help me rid
ourselves of Angier. It is the only
way to kow her mind.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, COLORADO -- DAY

Angier looks up from Borden's diary.  Pale. He flips pages
and pages forward TO THE LAST ENTRY...
BORDEN (V.O.): Today my mistress proves her
truthfulness. Not to me, you
understand.
88.
BORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D): I have been convinced since she led
me to Root... today, Olivia proves
her love  for me to you, Angier.
Angier looks up from the notebook.  Mind reeling.
BORDEN (V.O.) (CONT'D): Yes, Angier.  She gave you this
noteboook at my request.  Yes, she
led me to Root, and yes, Tesla is
merely the key to my dairy, not to
my trick. Did you really think I
would part with my secret so easily
after so much?  Good-bye, Angier,
may you find solace for your thwarted
ambition back in yout American home.
Angier STARES at the pages, unblinking.  JUMPS to his feet...

INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY

Angier STRIDES up to the fence.
ANGIER:
TESLA!: (nothing)
TESLA!!: Angier takes his cane and starts running its METAL TIP across
the eletrified fence- causing SPARKING and CRACKLING.
ANGIER (CONT'D): ALLEY, GET OUT HERE AND LET ME IN!!
Alley emerges from the building, consufed.

INT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY

Alley opens the door-  Angier BURSTS IN past him, ENRAGED.
ANGIER: I've veen played for a fool!
ALLEY: Who by?
ANGIER: Tesla never made a machine like the
one I asked for.
ALLEY: We never said he had.
ANGIER: You let me believe that he had, Alley!
(MORE): 89.
ANGIER (CONT'D): You stole my money because your
funding  was cut off- you've been
shooting sparks at my top hat,
laughing at me all along while you
use my money to stave off ruin.
I've  seen Edison's men-
ALLEY: Where?
ANGIER: In the hotel.  I've every mind to
bring them up here myself-
TESLA: That would be unwise, Mr.Angier.
Tesla is holding a cage containing a large tabby CAT.
TESLA (CONT'D): It is true, sir, that you are your
one remaining financier.  But we
have not stolen your money...
ALLEY: Sir, my cat?
Tesla silences Alley with a tiny GLANCE.
ALLEY (CONT'D): When I told you I could make your
machine I spoke the simple truth.
Science is just a name for the art
of rendering the exotic mundane.  It
has no boundaries- its very purpose
is to destroy boundaries.
ANGIER: Then why isn't the machine working?
Tesla gives Angier the slightest of smiles.
TESLA: Because exact science, Mr.Angier, is
not an exact science.  The machine
simply does not operate as expected.
It needs continued examination.
ANGIER: Where did my top hat go?
ALLEY: Nowhere.
Alley points to the top hat, which is sitting on a workbench.
90.
ALLEY (CONT'D): We've tried the damn thing a dozen
times.  And the hat went nowhere.
TESLA: Which is why we need to rey a
different material.  It may provoke
a different result.
Tesla opens the cage and points the open end at Alley.
TESLA (CONT'D): You don't expect me to handle the
thing myself?
Alley reluctantly reaches into the cage and pulls out the
TERRIFIED CAT.  He jumps down into the pit and secures the
animal bu its collar to a eye-hook sunk into the ground.
ALLEY: You are responsible for whatever
happens to this animal, Doctor.
Alley pulls himself out of the pit, and Tesla CHARGES the
generator.
The cat stares up at the machine around it and HISSES.
Without ceremony, Tesla FIRES the machine.  As before, large
BOLTS spew from the head of the machine, down towards the
unseen cat.  The machine build to a DEAFENING ROAR, then
sputters out.
Silence.  The three men begin edging towards the pit.
Suddenly, a terrifying SCREECH.  The cat is still there,
still tied to the hook.
Alley breathes a sigh of relief and starts to free the car.
Tesla looks frustated.  Suddenly, the cat bursts free of
Alley and ROCJETS through the open side door of the lab.
ANGIER: I'll go.
Angier limps after the cat.

EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- CONTINUOUS

Angier sees the cat disappearing along the edge of the
building and into the forest beyond.
Angier follows.

EXT. FOREST -- CONTINUOUS

Angier pushes his way through the dense undergrowth, trying
to keep up, but the cat has disappeared.
91.
ANGIER: Here, kitty, kitty.
Suddenly, a HORRIBLE SCREECHING reaches Angier.  He begins
to follow the noise.
He stops at the opening of a tiny GLADE, no more than ten
feet across.
Two IDENTICAL CATS are fighting viciously in front of Angier.
He tries to separate the two animals, and succeeds in grabbing
one.  The other cat RACES off.
Angier takes a few steps after it, then FREEZES, staring at-
TOP HATS.  Clustered in a small glads.  The first cat slinks
its way through them.
The SECOND BLACK cat jumps from Angier's hands- RACES into
the glade, HISSING, SPITTING, CHASING the first cat into the
woods beyond-
Angier is left alone in the clearing, staring at the pile of
dozens of IDENTICAL TOP HATS.

EXT. PORCH, TESLA'S LABORATORY -- DAY

The top hats are in a pile on the dark.  Tesla is at the
table, measuring two HATS with a pair of Calipers.  Angier
and Alley are watching.
ANGIER: So the machine was working?
ALLEY: I never bothered to check the
calibration.  The hat never moved.
TESLA: These things never quite work as you
expect them to, Mr. Angier.  That's
one of the principal beauties of
science.
Tesla looks carefully at the hat in his hands.  It has a
tiny TEAR on the inside of the brim.  He picks up another
hat.  It has the same TEAR.
TESLA (CONT'D): We'll need a couple of weeks to iron
out the-
(looks at hats)
-problems with the machine.  I'll
send word when it's ready.
Angier, still dazed, takes his cane and heads for the door.
92.
TESLA (CONT'D): Don't forget your hat.
Angier stops and looks at the pile of hats.
ANGIER: Which one is mine?
TESLA: They are all your hat, Mr. Angier.
Tesla smiles at him.

INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

Borden's daughter, JESS, now four, runs into the room and
tries to hop up into his lap.  Laughing, he helps her up.
JESS: Are we going to the zoo this
afternoon, daddy?
BORDEN: Daddy's got some business this
afternoon.
JESS: But you promised.
BORDEN: Did I?
Jess nods at him, solemly.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Then go to the zoo we shall.
Borden holds the newspaper open for her to look at.
BORDEN (CONT'D): (gestures to newspaper)
Who's that?
A large advertisement features a picture of Borden: The
Professor- England's premiere magician!
JESS: That's you, daddy?
Borden picks up the girl off of his lap and stands.
BORDEN: Daddy has some errands to run.  I'll
be back before you know it, so get
ready.
Borden walks to the door.  As he does, Sarah enters, avoiding
his eyes, then ducking him as he tries to kiss her.
93.
She reaches for the sherry decanter.  He watches her pour.
Sarah looks at him, eyes red from crying.
SARAH: We each have our vices.
Borden moves to her, gentle concern in his eyes.
BORDEN: Sarah.  Whatever you may think, your
only competitions for my affections
is my little girl.  I love you.  I
will always love you, and you alone.
She looks into his eyes.  Fascinated.
SARAH: You mean it today.
BORDEN: Absolutely.
SARAH: That makes it so much harder when
you don't.
She turns from him.  Borden watches her sadly.  Leaves.

EXT. CANAL -- AFTERNOON

Borden walks along a disused strecth of industrial canal
that snakes through the poorer neighborhoods of the city.
Borden wanders into a tunel.  Another man is waiting for
him -- Fallon.
Fallon hands Borden a folded piece of paper.  He studies it.
BORDEN: More shopping.  She doesn't like the
smell of money, doesn't she?
Fallon looks away.  Borden tears up the paper.
BORDEN (CONT'D): The little lady wants to visit the
Zoo, I thought you could take her.
I'll do it tomorrow, if not.
(looks at his feet)
Sarah... she knows.  At least, she
knows things aren't right.
(looks at Fallon,
pleading)
Help me with her.  Try and convince
her that I love her.  Please.
Borden, embarrassed, pats Fallon on the shoulder and makes
off down the path.  Fallon sets off in the opposite direction.
94.

INT. OLIVIA'S APARTMENT

Olivia, barely wearing a dressing gown, answers the door to
Borden.  She pulls him in, trying to draw him into a kiss,
but he backs away.
OLIVIA: What is it. Freddy?
BORDEN: Please don't call me that.  It's
nothing, just... sometimes things
seem... wrong.
Olivia looks at him.  Cold.
OLIVIA: Freddy, I've told you before.  When
you're with me, you're with me.
Leave your family at home where they
belong.
BORDEN: I'm trying, Olivia.  Please.
OLIVIA: I'll get dressed.
Borden watches her move down the hall.
OLIVIA (O.S.) (CONT'D): I saw Fallon hanging around my house
again, after you left.
Olivia comes back in, half-dressed.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): There's something about him I don't
trust.
BORDEN: You trust me?
(off her look)
Then trust Fallon- he protects the
things I care about.

EXT. CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING

Angier walks out from the lobby.  The two MEN he saw before
are loading up their automobile.  Smiling, laughing.

EXT. ROAD, PIKE'S PEAK -- MORNING

The coach pulls to a stop.  Angier and the driver look up.
A plume of SMOKE is rising from further up the hill.
95.

EXT. CLEARING, PIKE'S PEAK -- MOMENTS LATER

Angier rounds the bend in the road and comes into view of
the laboratory.  He FREEZES.
The fence has been TORN DOWN.  Beyond it, the LAB has been
BURNED TO THE GROUND.  The metal tower is in SMOLDERING
PIECES.  Everything else is gone.
Angier notices a piece of metal lying in the road near him,
and, using his cane, flips it over.  It's Alley's sign warning
trespassers to keep out.

INT. ANGIER'S ROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- EVENING

Angier takes down the picture of Julia from the mantel.  He
studies it a second then puts it in the top of his packed
suitcase.

INT. LOBBY, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING

The BELLBOYS wrestle with Angier's cases as Angier walks to
the reception desk.  The manager smiles up at him.
MANAGER: We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.
Angier takes out his wallet and begins laying down bills.
MANAGER (CONT'D): We are sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave
as well.  He was very good to Colorado
Springs.  A very generous man.
Angier smiles up at him, absently and begins to leave.
MANAGER (CONT'D): Mr. Angier?
(Angier turns)
I didn't feel it was necessary to
tell the other men about the box.
Angier stops.
ANGIER: What box?
The manager smiles.

INT. HALLWAY, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- MORNING

Angier follows the manager down a darkened hallway.
MANAGER: We never use these rooms in the off -
season.  It's a shame.
96.
The manager stops at a set of DOUBLE DOORS and unlocks them.
He pushes them open and ushers Angier through.

INT. BALLROOM, CLIFF HOUSE INN -- CONTINUOUS

Angier steps into the massive, elegant room.
Standing on the dance floor is an ENORMOUS SHIPPING CRATE.
Stencilled on one side "COLORADO SPRINGS"
Angier walks up to the huge crate, awestruck.
An envelope addressed to him has been stuck to the front.
Angier stops it and begins to read.
TESLA (V.O.): My dear Angier, you will find what
you were looking for in the box.  I
apologize for leaving without saying
goodbye...

EXT. TESLA'S LABORATORY -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK

Under cover of night, a group of FIGURES ransack the
laboratory.
TESLA (V.O.): But I seem to have outstayed my
welcome in Colorado.
The figure begin setting FIRE to the sides of the laboratory.
TESLA (V.O.) (CONT'D): The extraordinary is not permitted
in science and industry.  Perhaps
you'll have more luck in your field,
mystified.  As to the use of the
machine...

INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT

The open crate sits empty at the side of a derelict stage.
Angier, in shirt sleeves is running cables to the MACHINE,
which is standing center stage.
TESLA (V.O.): Alley has written you a thorough set
of instructions.  I add only one
suggestion on using the machine-

EXT. COLORADO SPRINGS -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK

Alley holds open the door to a coach.  Tesla steps up into
it and looks back from the coach's open door, up the mountain.
97.
TESLA (V.O.): -Destroy it.  Drop it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.
High on the mountain, the laboratory is ABLAZE.
TESLA (CONT'D): Such thing will only bring you
misery.
Tesla folds himself into the coach, shutting the door as it
moes off down the mountain.

INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT

Angier moves to one side of the stage where he makes a hash
mark with a piece of chalk.
ANGIER (V.O.): Tesla's warning is as unheard as he
knew it would be.  Today I tested
the machine...
He loads A GUN and places it next to the machine.
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D): Taking precautions in case Tesla
hadn't ironed out the kinks in its
operation...
Angier THROWS THE SWITCH.  The machine GROANS into LIFE-
SPARKING and GLOWING as it gets up to full power.
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D): ...if it went wrong I would not want
to live like that for long...
Angier closes his eyes for an instant, listening to its power,
then THROWS HIMSELF INTO THE MACHINE.  HE IS CONSUMED BY
LIGHT...:
WHITE SCEEN-:
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D): But here, at the Turn,  I must leave
you, Borden...
The WHITS becomes handwriting an a page and we are-

INT. PRISON CELL -- DAY

Borden STARES at Angier's journal in disbelief.
ANGIER: Yes, you, Borden.  Sitting there, in
your cell, reading my diary.  Awaiting
your death.  For my murder.
98.
Borden SLAMS the journal shut.  Staring at it.

EXT. PRISON CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY

BORDEN stands at the fence again.
OWENS: Lord Caldlow was happy to hear that
you'd reconsidered his offer.
BORDEN: Angier's journal, the "gesture of
good faith"?  It's a fake.
OWENS: (surprised)
I assure you it's not.
BORDEN: It has to be-  it refers to events
that happened after his death.
OWENS: Clever predictions, I'm sure.  The
provenance of the journal is clear
and under no doubt.  It's written in
Angier own hand, of which we have
numerous examples.
(looks at Borden)
What makes you think it's a fake?
Borden looks away, uncomfortable.
BORDEN: It doesn't matter.
Borden leans forward and stuffs ROLLED PAPERS through the
fence.  Owens takes them carefully.
BORDEN (CONT'D): My tricks.  All of them.
OWENS: Including the Transported Man?  Lord
Caldlow will be very pleased.
BORDEN: No he won't.  They're not complete-
you only have the Pledge and Turn
for each.
Owens leafs through the papers, annoyed.
OWENS: Without the Prestige for each trick
these are wothless.
99.
BORDEN: You'll get the rest after you bring
my daughter here.
Owens looks at Borden.
BORDEN (CONT'D): I want to say goodbye.

INT. BORDEN'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Jess sits at the foot of the stairs, listening to her parents
SHOUT at each other in the living room.  She is CRYING.
BORDEN (O.S.): Stop it!  Just stop it!
SARAH: Deny it all you want- I know!

INT. LIVING ROOM, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Sarah is WILD, eyes red, hair a mess.  Utterly DISTRAUGHT
Borden is trying to calm her.
BORDEN: Sarah, it's not true!  I've told you
Olivia means nothing to me!
SARAH: I'll go yo her!  I know what you
really are, Alfred!
BORDEN: (quietly firm)
Sarah.  You can't do that.

INT. HALLWAY, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Jess looks up. Fallon is standing above her.  Listening.
SARAH (O.S.): I'll do what I have to!
Jess reaches up a hand.  Fallon takes it in his.
BORDEN (O.S.): Sarah, you can't talk like this!

INT. LIVING ROOM, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Sarah turn to face Borden.  Deperate.
SARAH: I can't live like this!
100.
BORDEN: (angry)
What do you want from me!
Sarah pauses.  Catches her breath.
SARAH: (quiet)
I want you to be honest with me.  No
tricks, no lies, no secrets.
Borden calms.  Looks into her eyes.  Nods.
SARAH (CONT'D): Do you love me?
Borden looks into her eyes.  Sincere.
BORDEN: Not today.
Sarah takes this in.  Borden watches, helpless.
SARAH: (whispers)
Thank you.
Borden watches her turn away from him.

INT. HALLWAY, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Jess reaches up to Fallon with her other hand.  He takes her
gently in his arms.  We stay on Jess's tear-stained face
over Fallon's shoulder as he carries her up the stairs.

INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- MORNING

CLOSE ON A POSTER: Borden, in costume, looking intense: THE
PROFESSOR- MASTER OF DARK FORCES.  As we PULL BACK we hear a
GENTLE CREAKING...: PULL BACK past a hanging PAIR OF FEET, one shoe missing...
wider shows up that it is SARAH, HANGING BY HER NECK FROM A
BEAM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP.  Gently swinging.

INT. PUBLIC HOUSE -- NIGHT

Cutter is finishing his meal at the bar.  He goes to take a
swig from his pint and FREEZES- at the bottom of the glass: A PLAYING CARD.  He looks around the bar.  No one he
recognizes.  He reaches into the glass.
Cutter pulls out the card- an ADDRESS is written up one side.

EXT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT

Cutter  walks along labyrinthine streets.  Stops at an
ABANDONED THEATRE. He looks up at the building, then enters.
101.

INT. ALBERT HALL -- EVENING

Cutter makes his way past the tattered box office and into
the derelivt auditorium.
In the middle of the room is the CRATE.  Cutter stands and
stares at it.
MALE VOICE (O.S.): Who's there
Cutter turns.  A STAGEHAND.  His eyes are solid white.  The
man is clearly BLIND.
CUTTER: I- I'm looking for an old friend-
ANGIER (O.S.): I heard about a booking...
Cutter turns.  Angier is behind him, leaning on his cane.
Beside Angier is a SECOND BLIND STAGEHAND.
ANGIER (CONT'D): Nice little theatre.  Good up-and-
coming magician.
CUTTER: You came back.
ANGIER: It's a good to see you, John.
Cutter sizes Angier up.  Looks around the theatre.
CUTTER: Good rehearsal space.  Blind
stagehands.  I like it-
(knowing smile)
You always had an eye for publicity.
Angier sits in one of the stalls.  Cutter follows suit.
ANGIER: I need your help,  John.  My last
show.  A limited engagement.
CUTTER: Your last show?
ANGIER: A wise man once told me that obsession
was a young man's game.  I'm almost
done.  One thing left...
(points at crate)
The real Transported Man.
Cutter stares at the crate.
102.
CUTTER: You want to design a show around it?
ANGIER: i don't want you backstage,  I need
you front of house, managing.
Cutter considers this.  Uncertain.
ANGIER (CONT'D): i need you calling in any favours
and connections you have left to get
us the right booking for the run.
CUTTER: What sort of booking are you after?
ANGIER: The sort that Borden can't ignore.
Cutter looks at Angier.  Nods.

EXT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- DAY

A long, expensive CARRIEGE creeps out to a halt outside the
abandoned theatre, and the confused driver pulls over.
DRIVER: This is the address, sir.
The carriage opens, an imposing man in his 50's steps out,
looks the place up and down, then heads inside.

INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS

The man enters the auditoruim and stares downat the BRIGHTLY
LIT STAGE.: Cutter moves quickly up the aisle, hand outstretched.
CUTTER: Mr.Ackerman.  It's an honor to see
you again, sir.
Ackerman shakes Cutter's hand.
ACKERMAN: When you said you only wanted to
show me one trick it piqued my
interest.
CUTTER: It's a very special trick.
Mr.Ackerman.
Angier has appeared.
103.
ANGIER: Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.
ACKERMAN: Likewise, I'm sure.  Let's get on,
shall we?
Angier smiles.
CUTTER: (down to stage)
Turn it on, please.
After a moment, the machine SPARKS INTO LIFE.  ELECTRIC BOLTS
CASCADE from the GLOBE and SPLASH on the stage.
ACKERMAN: Very pretty.
Angier smiles at Cutter and head back down the stage.  he
STEPS himself into the machine and DISAPPEARS.
The machine SPUTTERS out and is silent.
ACKERMAN (CONT'D): That's it, Cutter?  He simply
disappears?  That's not a trick.  He
has to come back.  There has to be a-
VOICE (O.S.): -a Prestige?
ACKERMAN: Exactly-
Ackerman begins to turn around- then STOPS-
ANGIER IS STANDING DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM.
Ackerman is dumfounded.  He looks back down at the stage.
ACKERMAN (CONT'D): (quiet, haunted)
Pardon me.  It's very rare to see...
real magic.  it's been many years
since I've seen...
Anckerman steadies himself;
ANGIER: Are you interested in helping us?
ACKERMAN: (nods)
Yes. But you'll have to dress it up
a little.  Disguise it.  Give them
enough reason to doubt it.
104.

INT. STAGE MANAGER'S OFFICE, PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- DAY

Merrit sits eating a sandwich.  The door to his office opens
and ACKERMAN strides in.  Merrit STRUGGLES to his feet.
MERRIT: (surprised)
Mr. Ackerman.  When they said...I
didn't think you'd be here in person.
Ackerman sits without being asked to.
ACKERMAN: I have an act for your venue.
MERRIT: (flustered)
Well, of course, sir...But I'm afraid
I'm booked.  The Moscow Ballet.
They're playing through next year.
ACKERMAN: Get rid of them.  This is a magical
act.  An excellent one.  I believe
you booked his first engagement
several years ago.  The Great Danton.
MERRIT: You really want me to-
Ackerman stands.
MERRIT (CONT'D): I'll do it.  Of course.
Ackerman picks up a pen and paper from Merrit's desk.
ACKERMAN: (smiles)
There will be one hundred
performances.  No more, no less.
Five perfomances a week.  No
matinees, no weekends.
Ackerman scribbles onto the paper and hands it to Merrit.
ACKERMAN (CONT'D): (smiles)
And that's what you'll be charging
for each ticket.  Good day.
Ackerman sweeps out of the room, leaving Merrit dumbfounded,
staring at the scrap of paper in his hands.

INT. RESTAURANT -- EVENING

Olivia and Borden are seated across from each other, finishing
their meal.  Olivia watches Borden eat.
105.
OLIVIA: You haven't spopken about her, Freddy.
Not once.
BORDEN: Who?
OLIVIA: Don't be cruel.
BORDEN: Why would I talk about her to you?
OLIVIA: Because she was part of your life
and now she's gone.
Borden says nothing.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): She wanted to meet me the day before
she killed herself.  Said she had
something to tell me about you.
(looks away)
I was such a coward, I couldn't bring
myself to face her.
(looks at Borden)
What would she have said, I wonder?
BORDEN: (snaps)
You want the truth about me, Olivia?
(she nods, wary)
I never loved Sarah.
OLIVIA: (appalled)
You married her, had a child with
her-
BORDEN: Part of me loved her.  But part of
me didn't.  The part that found you.
The part that's sitting here now.  I
love you.  That is the truth that
matters.
Olivia tosses her napkin on her plate.
OLIVIA: You could be sitting in some other
restaurant talking to some other
woman about me that way.  It's unhuman
to be so cold.
Borden watches her rise from the table.  She looks at him.
106.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): By the way, have you seen who's opened
at the Pantages?
(Borden shakes head)
The Great Danton.
BORDEN: He's back?
OLIVIA: After two years.  And he has a new
trick.  They're saying it's the best
that London's ever seen.
Borden cannot hide his reaction.
OLIVIA (CONT'D): If you could see the look on your
face, Professor.  You should go to
him- you deserve each other.
Olivia smiles at him and leaves.

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING

Borden, in disguise, takes his seat halfway along the aisle.
The lights dim.  Curtains RISE on a simple stage.  Bare except
for a WATER-FILLED GLASS TANK.
Borden STIFFENS in his seat, perplexed.
Angier limps onto the stage.  Addresses the audience.
ANGIER: Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick
of the evening is one that involves
considerable risk.
(removes his coat)
Anyone in the audience who would be
irrevocable damaged by seeing a man
drown should leave now, for when I
tell you that the young lady who
taught performing it, you will
understand the seriousness of the
danger involved.
Borden watches the hook descend from the flies.  Remembering.
INSERT CUT: Borden STARES as Angier desperately BRUSHES the
water from Julia's face.

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- LATER

Angier steps forward as another curtain is drawn up behind
him, revealing TESLA'S MACHINE.
107.
ANGIER: In my travels I have seen the future,
and it is a strange future indeed.
The world is on the brink of new and
terrifying possibilities.
The audience RECOILS in terror as the MACHINE is STARTED and
BOLTS fly from it.  SMOKE drift over the audience.
Borden inches forward in his seat.  Angier stands in front
of the machine, silhouetted by the FRENZY of electricity
behind him.  He TOSSES his cane to his assistant and steps
into the machine.
The audience SCREAMS as large bolts BLAST from the machine
and wrap themselves around ANGIER'S ARMS and legs.
Borden is watching very carefully.  Angier is almost
impossible to see as the machine builds to a climax, but,
just before it does; Borden catches a glimpse of ANGIER'S
BODY FALLING THROUGH A TRAP DOOR.
The machine sputters out.  Angier has DISAPPEARED.  The lights
are dim.  A FOLLOW SPOT FIRES into the BOXES, audience looks
up with a gathering commotion-
ANGIER IS STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE ROYAL BOX, thirtyfeet
above stalls.  He smiles down at the audience.
ANGIER (CONT'D): Man's reach exceeds his IMAGINATION!
The audience breaks into a MASSIVE STANDING OVATION.

INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

Fallon is at the workbench, staring at a sketch of Tesla's
machine.  Borden paces, AGITATED.
BORDEN: Why only 100 performances?  Do his
methods dictate it, or is it simply
a publicity move?
Borden walks back and stares at the sketch.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Fifty yards in a second.  And all I
know is that he uses a trapdoor.
What's going on under that stage?

EXT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- NIGHT

The theatre is closed, and tree BLIND STAGEHANDS are
wreastling a TARP-WRAPPED BOX onto a cart in the alleyway
behind the theatre.
Fallon is watching from the shadows.
108.

EXT. LABYRINTHINE STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

Fallon shadows the cart as it slowly makes its way.

EXT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- LATER

Fallon watches from further down in the alley as the Blind
Stagehands unload the box onto a dolly and wheel it through
the stage door.
He moves closer, then STOPS.  Seeing something.  CUTTER has
emerged from a nearby doorway and slipped through the stage
door.

INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS

The blind stagehand wheel the tarp-covered box to two LARGE
METAL DOORS in the floor of the auditorium and start hooking
it up to a winch.  The metal doors open with a metal HOWL...
Cutter slips down the aisle.  WATCHING.
BLIND STAGEHAND:
WHO'S THERE!: The man turns precisely to Cutter, flasing his white eyes.
CUTTER: It's Cutter.
BLIND STAGEHAND: What do you want?
CUTTER: I'm looking for Angier.
ANGIER: You found him.
Cutter turns.  Angier approaches.
ANGIER (CONT'D): I told you, John- I don't want you
backstage on this one.
CUTTER: What are they doing?
ANGIER: Disposing of the Prestige materials.
Cutter looks down at the BLACK HOLE in the floor.
CUTTER: What's down there?
Angier looks at him, serious.
109.
ANGIER: Do you really want to know?
Cutter considers Angier's grave tone.
CUTTER: Perhaps not.
Cutter leaves by the stage door.

INT. BORDEN'S WORKSHOP -- DAY

Borden sits at his work bench.  Fallon fiddles with his howler
hat.
BORDEN: They do this every night.  After
each performance?
Fallon nods.  Borden gets to his feet with a sigh.  Turns to
a POSTER on the wall- "The Great Danton Perform THE REAL
TRANSPORTED MAN- 100 SHOWS ONLY"
He studies the image of Angier.  There is a small DEVIL
looking over his shoulder.
BORDEN (CONT'D): We're done.
(turns to Fallon)
Let him have this trick.  You're not
to go back there.  I don't need to
know his secret.  Leave him alone.
Fallon puts on his hat with a shrug.

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE -- EVENING

A packed house.  Many hands raised.  Move in on a BEARDED
MAN, his gloved hand tentatively rising into the air.  IT IS
BORDEN.: A GLAMOROUS ASSISTANT beckons Borden from the aisle.  He
shuffles along his row towards her.  Embarrassed.
Borden and four other VOLUNTEERS follow the Assistant down
towards the stage...
On which stands Angier, leaning on his cane, smiling.  Looming
over him is the large and complex ELECTRICAL MACHINE.  Borden
STARES at the machine as he mounts the stage.
Borden, FASCINATED, and the other volunteers look over the
vast machine.  As Angier GESTURES theatrically at the various
features of the metal and glass apparatus.
As the Assistant leads the Volunteers to the side of the
stage, Borden slips through the gas at the side of the
curtains-
110.

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, BACKSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS

-looks around, disoriented, then darts for some stairs leading
below stage where he runs into a burly STAGEHAND.
STAGEHAND: Where'd you think you're going?
Borden pulls off his beard.
BORDEN: I'm part of the act, you fool!
The Stagehand raises his eyebrows and steps aside.  Borden
RACES down below the stage.  Cutter approaches the Stagehand.
CUTTER: Who was that?

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Angier throws switches on his machine.  As it GROANS into
life, SPARKING and CRACKLING, Angier gares at it, forgetting
his audience.  Entraced.  Possessed.

INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Borden fumbles through the darkned area, lit by flashes and
sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above.  He
GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE
EYES sitting nearby.  Borden waves a hand in front of the
Stagehand's face.  He is BLIND.  Borden moves on.

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- NIGHT

Angier, facing the audience, steps backwards into the machine.
He looks up at the electricity sparking just above him.

INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

Borden lights a MATCH.  In front of him is a LARGE GLASS
TANK FILLED WITH WATER, ITS LID PROPPED OPEN.  Borden frowns.

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS

BOLTS of electricity draw inwards, wrapping Angier in a ball
of LIGHTING which CRACKS-

INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- CONTINUOUS

The ROOM fills with lIGHT as a TRAPDOOR snaps open and a
BODY DROPS INTO THE TANK.  The lid of the tank and trapdoor
above SNAP SHUT, leaving the tank, and Borden, in complete
DARKNESS.: 111.

INT. PANTAGE'S THEATRE, ONSTAGE -- CONTINUOUS

The Machine sputters to a stop.  Angier is GONE.  The audience
sits, WAITING.

INT. BENEATH THE STAGE -- NIGHT

Borden the tank, ANGIER IS DROWING.  His rolling EYES fixed
on Borden, he POUNDS desperetely on the thick glass, SCREAMING
BUBBLES...: Borden, HORROFIED, tries forcing the lif ot the tank open.
It's sealed shut.  He leaves the tank and begins searching
around under the stage.  He finds a SPANNER.
Borden SMASHES again and again at the glass of the tank,
which spiders, then CRACKS, and finally GIVES WAY.
WATER bursts from the tank, sweeping Angier's body into
Borden, and both of them onto gournd.
Above them we can hear YELLING.  Borden rolls Angier onto
his side and POUNDS on his back.  Water and blood OOZE from
the man's lungs.  His eyes are dilated and lifeless:
ANGIER IS DEAD.: Borden is frozen, unable to move.
Cutter appears behind him, SHOCKED by what he sees.  Borden
turns to look at him, his eyes wild with confusion.
CUTTER: What did you do?

INT. MORQUE -- EVENING

A MORTICIAN pulls back a sheet draped over a CORPSE.
Angier's lifeless eyes stare up at us.  Cutter looks at
Angier, the up at the Mortician.  Nods.
JUDGE (V.O.): Alfred Borden, you have been found
guilty of the murder of Robert
Angier...

INT. COURTROOM -- DAY

borden stands chained to the dock.  The JUDGE has a piece of
black cloth draped over his wig.
JUDGE: You will, in one month's time, be
hanged by the neck until dead.  May
the Lord have mercy on your soul.
112.

INT. EVIDENCE ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY

A POLICEMAN shows Owens into the room, walking him past all
of the equipment to the far end where Cutter stands staring
at the MACHINE'S CRATE.
OWENS: Mr.Cutter?
(Cutter turns)
Owens.
They shake hands.
CUTTER: Thank you for coming, Mr.Owens.
It's fallen to me to dispose of
Mr.Angier's equipment.  Looking at
the manifest, it's cleat that Lord
Caldlow has purchased the bulk of
the items.
OWENS: Mr.Cutter, if you needed to know
where to deliver the items you surely
could have just-
CUTTER: It's not just that, Mr.Owens.  There
is a particular item
(turns to crate)
This time, in fact, that I wish to...
well, that is to say, I want to-
OWENS: You wnat to buy it instead.
CUTTER: I suppose so, yes.
Owens moves closer to the crate.  Sees the COLORADO SPRINGS
stencil.
OWENS: This is the machine?
(off look)
I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant
about procuring this particular item.
CUTTER: Perhaps if I dould talk to Lord
Caldlow in person.
OWENS: Out of the question, I'm afraid.
Cutter nods.  Owens starts to walk away.  Turns.
113.
OWENS (CONT'D): of course, I suppose... if, in the
course of your delivery arrangements
your paths were to cross... I can't
stop you from speaking your mind.
Cutter nods.

INT. CONDEMNED MAN'S CELL, NEWGATE PRISON -- MORNING

Borden is sitting quietlt in a large cell.
Sullen opens the door.
SULLEN: (sardonic)
Still here, Borden?
Borden looks up.
BORDEN: For now.
SULLEN: Got a visitor.  Lord Caldlow.  With
a little girl.
Borden HURRIES to his feet.

EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY

Borden, clutching an envelope, is escorted across the yard,
PEERING at the fence.  He catches a glimpse of this daughter
waling beside a man on the wooden section.
As Borden reaches the fence he CROUCHES to greet his little
girl, forcing the Sullen and the other Warder to crouch to
undo his chains.
BORDEN: Jess, how are you?
Jess SMILES at him and reaches through the fence.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Are you alright?
She nods.
BORDEN (CONT'D): I've missed you.  Fallon's missed
you.  We both have.
Borden drinks in her gace, her hair.  She grasps the fence.
JESS: Can I come in there, Daddy?
114.
BORDEN: Everything's going to be okay.
It is only then that he notices the HAND ON HER SHOULDER.
He rises to come face-to-face with Lord Caldlow-
BORDEN (CONT'D): You must be Lord-
-who is ROBERT ANGIER.  Risen from the dead.
ANGIER: (English accent)
Caldlow.  Yes, I am.  I always have
been.
Borden STARES at Angier.
BORDEN: I saw you die.
Angier just SMILES.
ANGIER: They flatter you with all those
chains, Alfred.  Don't they know you
can't escape without your little
rubber ball?
Borden says nothing.
ANGIER (CONT'D): All I wanted to do was prove that I
was the better magician.  But you
couldn't leave me alone.
BORDEN: You were always afraid to get your
hands dirty...
(looks down at his
Jess)
Not anymore.
ANGIER: No.  Not anymore.  And I win.  Because
no one cares about the man in the
box, the man who disappears.
BORDEN: You win.  But don't take my little
girl...
Angier looks at Borden.  Bitter
ANGIER: I know how hard it is to have someone
so precious taken away, don't I
(MORE): 115.
ANGIER (CONT'D): Borden?  But you can't take her with
you know, can you?  She'll be looked
after.  Good-bye, Professor.
Angier gently pulls Jess back from the fence.  She PROTESTS
Desperate,  Borden holds out the envelope.
BORDEN: Wait.  Don't you want this?  You
paid for it.
ANGIER: Your secret.
Borden nods.  Angier steps up, takes the envelope.
ANGIER (CONT'D): You always were the better magician,
Borden.  We both know that.
HE TEARS the envelope in half.  Then again.  And again...
ANGIER (CONT'D): But whatever your secret was, you'll
have to agree-
He tosses the peices on the ground.
ANGIER (CONT'D): (victorious)
-mine is better.
Angier TURNS.
BORDEN: Angier!  Let me say good-bye.  Please.
Angier stops.  Lets Jess come to fence.  She is crying.
JESS: When are you taking me home, Daddy?
BORDEN: Soon.  I promise.  Soon.
ANGIER: For God's sake, Borden.
BORDEN: Daddy's coming, I promise.  I promise.
Here-
Borden PRODUCES his RUBBER BALL.  Jess looks at it.
BORDEN (CONT'D): I promise.
116.
Borden VANISHES the rubber ball.  ANgier pulls Jess back
from the fence and starts walking away.  Borden rises.
BORDEN (CONT'D): You think this place can hold me,
Angier?
Angier continues walking Jess away.  Shaking this head.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Angier!
Borden is alone.  He watches as the wind scatters the pieces
of his prestige over the muddy yard.

EXT. LARGE COUNTRY ESTATE -- EVENING

Angier steps out of an ornate carriage with Jess.

INT. LARGE COUNTRY ESTATE -- EVENING

Cutter is in the drawing room, looking at the carriage clock
on the mantle.  Angier enters.  Cutter spots his reflection.
CAPTAIN: Dead God.
ANGIER: Hello, Cutter.
CUTTER: You're alive.
(Angier nods)
You're Lord Caldlow.
(Angier nods again)
How?
ANGIER: (shrugs)
*
I learned an American accent from-
CUTTER: (Angry)
How are you alive, Robert?!  I saw
you on the slab, for God's sake.
117.
Angier fixes Cutter with a steady gaze.
ANGIER: I magician never reveals his secrets.
The Housekeeper appears with Jess at her side.
HOUSEKEEPER: Go on, child.
Angier smiles kindly at her.
ANGIER: Good night, Jess.
They leave.
CUTTER: Who's the girl?
Angier says nothing.
CUTTER (CONT'D): I've seen her.  I've seen her in
court with Fallon...
Cutter, realizing, looks at Angier, SHOCKED.
CUTTER (CONT'D): (quiet)
What have you done?
ANGIER: She needs looking after-
CUTTER: She needs her father, but you're
letting him hang.  And I helped you.
Cutter moves to the door.  In a daze.  Pauses.
CUTTER (CONT'D): I came here tonight to beg Lord
Caldlow to let me destroy that
machine.  But I won't beg you for
anything.
ANGIER: You don't have to.  I'm going to
make sure the machine. is never used
again.
(shrugs)
A good magician never repeats his
tricks.
118.
Cutter considers this.  Makes a decision.
CUTTER: Then, Lord Caldlow, where would like
me to deliver it?
ANGIER: My theatre.  It belongs with the
Prestige materials.
Cutter lookd at Angier.  Sad.
CUTTER: I once told you about the sailor who
described drowing to me...
ANGIER: (nods)
He said it was like going home.
CUTTER: I was lying.  He said it was agony.
Cutter opens the door.  Angier watches him go.

EXT. PRISON YARD, NEWGATE PRISON -- MORNING

Borden is at the fence.  Fallon is on the other side.
BORDEN: We go alone now- both of us.  Only I
don't have as far to go as you.
Borden looks down at his feet.
BORDEN (CONT'D): You were right.  I should've left
him to his damned trick... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for so many things.  For
Sarah.  I didn't want to hurt her.
Fallon wipes tears from his face.  Borden looks at him.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Don't cry.  Not for me.  Go live
your life in full.  For both of us.
Borden pulls the RUBBER BALL from his pocket and BOUNCES it
up and down.  He TURNS to be led back into the prison,
DROPPING the ball.
The ball bounces gently past the fence.  Fallon catches it.

INT. PRISON CORRIDOR, NEWGATE PRISON -- MORNING

Borden is led along the empty corridor, braced by six guards.
119.
The procession stops at a large windowless metal door, sunk
deep into the wall.  Sullen opens the door and Borden is led
inside.  As Borden passes Sullen he leans in to his ear-
BORDEN: (quiet)
Are you watching closely?
Sullen stares back at him, terrified.

INT. DEATH CHAMBER, NEWGATE PRISON -- CONTINUOUS

The room is low and small. Two parallel beams, eight feet
high, run from one wall to the other.  Hanging from the center
of the beams is a chain.  Below the chian is a trap door.
Sullen locks the door to the chamber.

EXT. LARGE COUNTRY ESTATE -- DAY

Jess is playing in the grounds.  A NURSEMAID some distance
off chats to a GARDENER.
Jess looks up from playing.  Someone is there.  Cutter.

EXT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- EVENING

A CART pulls up to the side of the theatre.
Cutter and two WORKMEN step down from the cart and move to
the back of it.  Cutter pulls the tarp off the back of the
cart.  Underneath it is the MACHINE's CRATE.

INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- EVENING

The crate is sitting on the dolly in the auditorium.
CUTTER: Thank-you gents.
WORKMAN: Where do you want it?
CUTTER: Don't worry.  Someone's coming to
help.
The workmen levae.  Cutter looks at the crate.
Angier emerges from the darkness.

INT. DEATH CHAMBER

The warders remove Borden's chains and shackles and replace
them with strong leather belts that bind his feet together
and his hands to his sides.
They shuffle him forward onto the trapdoor.
120.

INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT

Angier and Cutter load the crate onto a platform suspended
by a rope.  Angier pulls open the two metal doors sunk into
the floor.
Cutter begins turning a WHICH, lowering the crate into the
HOLE.  Angier indicates a pile of bricks and a bag of sand.
CUTTER: I'm bringing this over after we're
done.
ANGIER: Cautions as ever, Cutter.  No one's
going to use the place.  I own it.

INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- EVENING

Angier slowly climbs down a ladder from the hole to join
Cutter in the darkness below.
Cutter is standing next to the platform and the crate.  The
only night comes from a LANTERN Angier is carrying.  We can
see only a small flicker of the high moldy walls of the
cellar, but it is a large open space.
CUTTER: No room left- you couldn't have
acommodated 100 performances.
ANGIER: It's a good thing I retired early
then.
Angier puts the lattern and his cane on the lif of the crate
and the two men heft ir off the platform.
ANGIER (CONT'D): We'll put it down the end.
Angier and Cutter move into the darkness with the crate.
From the small pool of light afforded by the lattern, we can
see that they are navigating their way through a large space
filled with LARGE GLASS BOXES.
They arrive at the end and set the crate down.
CUTTER: I'll go mix the cement.
Cutter looks at Angier, cold.
CUTTER (CONT'D): Take a minute to consider your
achiviement.
Cutter turns.
121.
ANGIER: Cutter, I tried not to involve you.
Cutter looks at Angier.  Nods.  Then disappears into darkness.

INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- MOMENTS LATER

Cutter comes across the stage and up through the auditorium.
Fallon is coming in the other direction.
As they pass they nod gravely at each other.

INT. DEATH CHAMBER, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY

Borden is held in place by the trapdoor by two warders.  The
HANGMAN walks up behind him and attaches a NOOSE to the chain
hanging above Borden.  He slips the other end of the noose
over Borden's neck.  Positions it under Borden's jaw.

INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- CONTINUOUS

Angier is alone bather in the lgiht of the lantern.  He turns
to the nearest glass box and smoothes a hand along its face.
ANGIER: (whisper)
No one cares about the man in the
box.
Behind him, a NOISE.
ANGIER (CONT'D): (calling)
Cutter?
No responses.

INT. DEATH CHAMBER, NEWGATE PRISON -- DAY

They WRDEN looks at Borden.
WARDEN: Alfred borden, on this day, in the
name of the King and the high court
of England, you will meet your end.
Do you have anything to say for
yourself.
Borden saus nothing.  The Warden gestures to the HANGMAn who
begins to PULL the lever.
BORDEN: (whisper)
Abacadabra.
The trap DROPS from under Borden and he FALLS into the room
below. His rope SNAPS to a halt-
122.

INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT

Angier PEERS down the row of glass boxes with the lantern.
ANGIER: (tense)
CUTTER?: Angier FREEZES.  He can hear a small THUD, THUD, THUD getting
closer, approaching from the darkness...
Angier FLINCHES as a RUBBER BALL bounces into the light-
Angier DROPS his cane to CATCH the ball.  He turns it around
in his hands, confused.
Light EXPLODES around him as a GUNSHOT rings out.
Angier stands for a moment, confused, staring at the ball,
then COLLAPSES to the ground, clutching at his stomach.
Fallon's BOWLER HAT breaks into the circle of light.  he is
holding a smoking pistol...
Angier drops the ball and it rolls across the floor, coming
to rest at Fallon's feet.  But it is not Fallon's gloved
hand that picks up the ball-
-it is a MUTILATED HAND, WITH 2 1/2 FINGERS MISSING.  Angier
looks up: ALFRED BORDEN REMOVES THE BOWLER HAT AND TAKES A BOW.
ANGIER (CONT'D): (weak)
You- you died.
Borden shakes his head.
Realization sweeps over Angier like a nightmare.
ANGIER (CONT'D): A brother.  A Twin.

INT. BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS -- FLASHBACK

Fallon DROPS into the coffin.  As fallon stares up at us, WE
SEE, FOR THE FIRST TIME,  SOMETHING FAMILIAR IN HIS FACE --
FALLON IS REALLY BORDEN IN DISGUISE.
ANGIER: You were Fallon.  The whole time...
Fallon/Borden's face disappears as Cutter seals his coffin.

INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE

Borden smiles.
123.
BORDEN: We were both Fallon.  And we were
both Borden.
Angier considers this.  Minds spinning.
ANGIER: Were you the one who went into the
box-

INT. STAGE -- EVENING -- FLASHBACK

As the ball bounces acroos the stage, Borden steps into the
cabinet, shutting the door behind him.
ANGIER (V.O.): -or the one who come back out?
Borden steps out of the second cabinet and catches the ball.

INT. DRESSING ROOM -- EVENING -- FLASHBACK

A stagehand wheels the two stage cabinets into the dressing
room and leaves.  Borden holts the door after him.
BORDEN (V.O.): We took turns.  The trick is where
we would swap...
Borden opens the first cabinet and pulls up the false bottom.
His TWIN BROTHER, in indentical stage clothes, uncurls himself
from the hidden compartment and hauls himself out.

INT. DRESSING ROOM -- LATER -- FLASHBACK

Fallon and Borden are seated at the makeup table.  Fallon
begins removing pieces of his costume and makeup and handing
them to the other brother.  As we watch,  THEY SWITHC
INDENTITIES.:

INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- EVENING

Angier stares up at Borden.  Appalled.
ANGIER: Cutter knew.  But I told him it was
too simple.  Too easy.
BORDEN: Simple, maybe.  But not easy.

INT. WORKSHOP -- EVENING -- FLASHBACK

Both Bordens are standing at the workbench.  One brother is
gripping the other by his wrist and placing a CHISEL on his
finger.
124.
He checks the placemen of the chisel against his own mutilated
fingers, adjust the chisel's position, them picks up the
hammer.
BORDEN (V.O.): Nothing easy about two men sharing
one life.
The second brother SWIGS from a gin bottle, then BITES down
a padded stick as the first brother BRINGS DOWN THE HAMMER-

INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- EVENING

Borden stares at his mutilated hand clasping the rubber ball.
ANGIER: What about Olivia?  And your wife?
BORDEN: We each loved one of them.  We each
had half a full life.  Enough for
us, but not for them.
Borden puts the ball in his pocket.  Tears in his eyes.
BORDEN (CONT'D): Sacrifice, Robert- that's the price
of a good trick.
Borden looks down at Angier with contempt.
BORDEN (CONT'D): But you wouldn't know anything about
that, would you?
Angier is dying.  He opens his mouth to talk, but his voice
is so wak that Borden has to stoop to hear him.
ANGIER: (very quiet)
I've made sacrificies.
BORDEN: It takes nothing to steal someone
else's work.
ANGIER: It takes everything.

INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Angier stands in front of Tesla's machine.  Loading the
pistol.  He places the pistol by the machine...
Angier takes off his jacket and steps towards the HISSING
machine.  BOTLS curl themselves around him.
ANGIER HURLS HIMSELF INTO THE LIGHT.
125.
This time we do not cut away.
The machine sputters out.
ANGIER IS STILL STANDING BENEATH IT.
ANGIER: (confused)
It didn't work.
VOICE (V.O.): Yes it did.
Angier turns...
ANOTHER ANGIER is standing on the chalk hashmark, STEAM rising
off his shoulders.
The first Angier lunges for the pistol and levels it at the
second Angier.
SECOND ANGIER: (horrified)
No, wait!  I'm the-
BANG!  BANG!  The firt Angier FIRES TWO SHOTS and, grim-
faced, drops the pistol.  SHOCKED.  He stumbles back, in a
daze, clothes still steaming.

INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT

Angier looks down, a slight smile on his face.  He gestures
to the lantern.
ANGIER: (weaker)
Do you want to see what it cost me?
You didn't see where you are, did
you?  Let me show you.
Angier slumps to the floor as he tries to reach for the
lantern.  He can't his hand to obey him.
ANGIER (CONT'D): It took courage to climb into that
machine every night...

INT. UNDER THE STAGE -- EVENING -- FLASHBACK

A drowing tank, identical to the one we have already seen.
A blind stagehand sits behind it, smoking.
ANGIER (V.O.): Not knowing if I'd be the Prestige....
Suddenly, a trap door flashes open as Angier falls from the
stage door and SPLASHES into the tank.  The lid snaps shut.
126.
ANGIER (V.O.) (CONT'D): Or the man in the box...
Angier pounds on the glass, frantic.  The blind stagehand
continues smoking.  Oblivious.

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

Two hands SLAM shut on the lid of a birdcage.
The blind stagehand are wrestling a LARGE CRATE onto a cart
in the alleyway behind the theatre.

INT. CELLAR, ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT

Angier stops trying tomove and leans back, resigned.
BORDEN: (scorn)
You went halfway around the world.
You spent a fortune.  You did terrible
things... and all of it for nothing.
Angier looks up at him with his last spark of competitiveness.
ANGIER: Nothing?  You never understood, id
you?  Why we did this?
(coughs)
The audience knows the truth- that
the world is simple.  Miserable.
Solid all the way through.  But if
you could fool them, even for a
second, you could make them wonder.
Then you got to see something very
special...
(coughs, looks up)
You really don't know?
Borden just stares at Angier.  Who smiles.
ANGIER (CONT'D): It was the look on their faced.
Angier's body TOPPLES over, KNOCKING over the lantern.  Borden
steps back as the oil spreads, flamming, fro the lantern.
CUTTER (V.O.): Every magic trick consists of three
parts, or acts...
Borden watches Angier for a moment, then turns to leave.
127.

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

The workshop from the opening of the film.  We now recognize
it as Borden's.  Cutter performs the bird cage trick for the
Little Girl we now know as Jess.
CUTTER (V.O.): The first part is called the Pledge.
Cutter is showing far the canary.

INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT

The burning lamp oil SPREADS LIGHT through the cellar...
CUTTER (V.O.): The second part is called the Turn.
I take the ordinary something...
Angier lies in his pooling blood.
Angier's eyes move around, looking at the shapes around him
increasing illuminated by the hellish light...

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Cutter WHIPS the shawl away-  cage and bird have disappeared.
CUTTER (V.O.): But you wouldn't clap yet.
Jess stares, EXPECTANT.  Cutter hols up his handkerchief-
covered hand...
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D): Because making something disappear
isn't enough...
Cutter whips the handkerchief from his hand, revealing a
canary.  Just then, Jess SEES something and JUMPS off the
chest, running past him...
CUTTER (V.O.) (CONT'D): You have to bring it back.
BORDEN IS IN THE DOORWAY- JESS LEAPS INTO HIS ARMS.  Borden
holds her tight.  Looks at Cutter, who is putting on his
coat.  Nods.  Cutter leaves.
Borden reaches into his pocket and hand Jess his rubber ball.
She smiles, then buries her head in his neck.
128.

INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- NIGHT

Borden STOPS at the ladder.  He notices the shadows from the
burning oil playing on the walls...
CUTTER (V.O.): Now you're looking for the secret...
Borden turns slowly to look back into the cellar,  PEERING
into the flickering light of the burning lamp oil.
CUTTER (CONT'D): But you won't find it...
Borden stares back into the cellar.  What he sees puts a
look on his face that is beyond words: LARGE GLASS TANKS.  DOZENS OF THEM.  ROW AFTER ROW STRECHING
INTO THE CAVERNOUS CELLAR.
CUTTER (CONT'D): ...because you don't really want to
know...
FLOATING IN BACH AND EVERY TANK, DRESSED IN ROTTING STAGE
CLOTHES, IS YET ANOTHER ROBERT ANGIER.

INT. ABANDONED THEATRE -- DAY

Cutter spreads MORTAT on the last BRICK of the wall he has
built in the opening to the cellar.
He places the brick in the wall, sealing it up.

EXT. FOREST -- DAY -- FLASHBACK

A cat slinks its way through a pile of top harts, knocking
one over as it disappears into the forest beyond.
CUTTER (V.O.): ...you want to be fooled.
We are left alone in the glade, staring at the top hats-
FADE OUT.:
CREDITS.:
END.:
FADE IN::
DAWN.  CRASHING SURF.: The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand.  He lies there.
A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE
BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat
a SAND CASTLE.  A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy.  The
Bearded Man tries to call to them, but they RUN OFF, FACES
UNSEEN.  He COLLAPSES.
The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back.
A JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up
the beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP.  Behind
them is a cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.

INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE -- LATER

The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY
JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.
ATTENDANT: (in Japanese)
He was delirious.  But asked for you
by name.  And...
(to the Security Guard)
Show him.
SECURITY GUARD: (in Japanese)
He was carrying nothing but this...
He puts a HANDGUN on the table.  The Elderly Man keeps eating.
SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D): ...and this.
The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the
gun.  The Elderly Man STOPS eating.  Picks up the cone.
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN: (in Japanese)
Bring him here.  And some food.

INT. SAME -- MOMENTS LATER

The Elderly Japanese Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down
his food.  He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN: (in English)
Are you here to kill me?
The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.
(CONTINUED): 2.
CONTINUED:: The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and
forefinger.
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN (CONT'D)
I know what this is.
He SPINS it onto the table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the
polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.
ELDERLY MAN: I've seen one before.  Many, many
years ago...
The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top, mesmerized.
ELDERLY MAN (CONT'D): A man I met in a half-remembered
dream...
MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP...
ELDERLY MAN (CONT'D): A man possessed of some radical
notions...
The Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering...
COBB (V.O.): What's the most resilient parasite?
CUT TO::

INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM -- NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)

The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored.  A young
Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.
COBB: A bacteria?  A virus?
Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-
COBB (CONT'D): An intestinal worm?
Saito's fork pauses, mid-air.  Cobb GRINS.  A third man is
at the table- ARTHUR.  He jumps in to save the pitch-
ARTHUR: What Mr.Cobb is trying to say-
COBB: An idea.
Saito looks at Cobb, curious.
(CONTINUED): 3.
CONTINUED::
COBB (CONT'D): Resilient, highly contagious.  Once
an idea's taken hold in the brain
it's almost impossible to eradicate.
A person can cover it up, ignore it-
but it stays there.
SAITO: But surely- to forget..?
COBB: Information, yes.  But an idea?  Fully
formed, understood?  That sticks...
(taps forehead)
In there, somewhere.
SAITO: For someone like you to steal?
ARTHUR: Yes.  In the dream state, conscious
defenses are lowered and your thoughts
become vulnerable to theft.  It's
called extraction.
COBB: But, Mr.Saito, we can train your
subconscious to defend itself from
even the most skilled extractor.
SAITO: How can you do that?
COBB: Because I am the most skilled
extractor.  I know how to search
your mind and find your secrets.  I
know the tricks, and I can teach
them to your subconscious so that
even when you're asleep, your guard
is never down.
Cobb leans forward, holding Saito's gaze.
COBB (CONT'D): But if I'm going to help you, you
have to be completely open with me.
I'll need to know my way around your
thoughts better than your wife, your
analyst, anyone.
(gestures around)
If this is a dream and you've got a
safe full of secrets, I need to know
what's in that safe.  For this to
work, you have to let me in.
Saito gives this a flicker of a smile.  Rises.  A BODYGUARD
opens double doors which give on to a LAVISH PARTY.
(CONTINUED): 4.
CONTINUED: (2):
SAITO: Gentlemen.  Enjoy your evening as I
consider your proposal.
They watch Saito leave.  Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-
ARTHUR: He knows.
Cobb motions silence.  A TREMOR starts, they steady their
glasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS FROZEN.
ARTHUR (CONT'D): What's going on up there?
And we-
CUT TO::

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM -- DAY(FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)

Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING
BATH.  The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs
level with the rim of the tub.
A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb.  This is NASH.  A
distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room.  Nash moves to
the window, parts the curtains.  Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-
WORLD CITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.
Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds
TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place.  Nash looks at Cobb's watch-
THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.
Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's
feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair.  Tubes connect the
briefcase to Arthur's wrist.
Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where
they pass under the door to the bedroom.  Through the crack
of the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running
to his wrist.  BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT -- DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)

Nash, ASLEEP.  Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the train
BUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK.
A Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously.  He
checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE
OTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.
Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME.
Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY
WHUMP- Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping face-
(CONTINUED): 5.
CONTINUED:: NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Another EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we-
CUT TO::

EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE -- NIGHT

A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE.  Cobb and Arthur
steady themselves against the wooden rail.  Several TILES
and pieces of MASONRY fall.  Below them a BLACK SEA churns.
Other GUESTS wander the massive terraces.
ARTHUR: Saito knows.  He's playing with us.
COBB: I can get it here.  The information's
in the safe- he looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.
Arthur nods.  Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.
ARTHUR: What's she doing here, Cobb?
Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed,
staring out at the sea.  This is MAL.  Cobb watches her.
COBB: You just get to your room.  I'll
take care of the rest.
ARTHUR: See that you do.  We're here to work.
Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head.  She nears Cobb.
Looks out at the DROP.  The WINDS WHIPS HER HAIR-
MAL: If I jumped, would I survive?
COBB: With a clean dive, perhaps.  Mal,
why are you here?
She turns to look at him.  Amused.
MAL: I thought you might be missing me...
She smiles.  He leans in, mesmerized.
(CONTINUED): 6.
CONTINUED::
COBB: I am.  But I can't trust you anymore.
She stares up at him, inviting.
MAL: So what?

INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE -- MOMENTS LATER

Mal sips champagne as she studies a Bacon painting.
MAL: Looks like Arthur's taste.
Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS
patrolling the castle at ground level.
COBB: Actually, Mr.Saito is partial to
postwar British painters.
He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.
COBB (CONT'D): Would you sit down?
Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wing back chair.
Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels
at Mal's feet.  She looks down at him.
MAL: Tell me...
Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.
MAL (CONT'D): Do the children miss me?
Cobb pauses.  He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's
ankle.  He looks up at her.
COBB: You can't imagine.
Mal looks away, uncomfortable.  Cobb gets to his feet, letting
out the rope as he moves back to the window.
MAL: What're you doing?
Cobb tosses the rope out-
COBB: Getting some air.
He tugs on the rope, testing.  The weight of the chair, with
Mal on it, holds.
(CONTINUED): 7.
CONTINUED::
COBB (CONT'D): Stay seated.  Please.
And with that, he JUMPS.  Mal considers the open window.

EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows.  He stops
at a particular one.  Gets out a glass cutter-
Suddenly he starts DROPPING-

INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE -- CONTINUOUS

The EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the
window-

EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb JOLTS to a stop 15ft lower.  He looks up at the bedroom
window.  Shakes his head.  Starts climbing back.

INT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE -- MOMENTS LATER

Cobb drops silently from the window into the darkened kitchen.
He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER onto
the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.

INT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at
the head of a GRAND STAIRCASE...
The Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows...
Cobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING-
PHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is
already there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering
the Guard SILENTLY to the floor.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb moves to a PAINTING.  With practiced hands he removes
it from the wall, revealing a SAFE.  Cobb spins the dial,
pulls it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into
his waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE.
THE LIGHTS COME ON.  Cobb freezes.
SAITO (O.S.): Turn around.
Cobb turns.  At the far end of the room: Saito.  Next to him
is Mal, gun in hand.  She smiles at Cobb.
MAL: The gun, Dom.
(CONTINUED): 8.
CONTINUED:: Cobb doesn't move.  Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag
Arthur into the room.  Mal puts the gun to his head.
MAL (CONT'D): Please.
Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table,
then SLIDES it along the polished ebony.  It comes to rest
HALFWAY down the length of the table.
SAITO: Now the envelope, Mr.Cobb.
Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the envelopes,
SLIDES it along the table.  Steps back, hands raised.
COBB: Did she tell you, or have you known
all along?
SAITO: That you're here to steal from me?

Or that we're actually asleep?
Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.
SAITO (CONT'D): I want to know who your employer is.
Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple.
COBB: No point threatening him in a dream.
MAL: That depends on what you're
threatening.  Killing him would just
wake him up... but pain?  Pain is in
the mind...
Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur drops,
SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold.
MAL (CONT'D): And, judging by the decor, we're in
your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
Cobb watches Arthur's PAIN.  Mal aims at Arthur's other leg...
Cobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished
surface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYES-
Arthur DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE
EARTHQUAKE- Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur's eyes stare
at the ceiling, DEAD, and we-
CUT TO:: 9.

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM -- DAY

Arthur's EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at
the tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free-
NASH: What're you doing?!  It's too soon-
FLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the
SILVER CASE on the bathroom floor.
ARTHUR: I know!  We have to reconnect the
loop before they wake up!
Arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the
bedroom- following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist-
SAITO LIES ON THE BED, ASLEEP.  Saito STIRS and we-
CUT TO::

INT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

Cobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the
building BUCKS and HEAVES-

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE -- CONTINUOUS

Saito and the Guards PANIC.  Mal walks calmly through the
destruction, picks up the envelope and turns to Saito.
MAL: He was close.  Very close.

EXT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb runs up the stairs, pulling out the SECOND ENVELOPE-

INT. DINING ROOM, CASTLE -- CONTINUOUS

Saito RIPS open the envelope, pulls out sheets of paper.  He
looks at Mal, PANICKED.  He turns to the Guards-
SAITO: Stop him!
Mal, confused, looks at the sheets of paper: THEY ARE BLANK.
Mal smiles, amused.

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, CASTLE -- CONTINUOUS

As Cobb runs up the stairs he reads the TYPEWRITTEN SHEETS
from his envelope, and we-
CUT TO:: 10.

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM -- DAY

Arthur OPENS the silver case: a COMPLEX MECHANISM of TUBES,
SYRINGES, DOSAGE CONTROLLERS.  Arthur's hands fly across the
machine's controls as he glances at Saito's STIRRING face-
ARTHUR: I'm not going to make it!  Wake Cobb!

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Nash turns to Cobb.  Raises his hand and SMACKS him across
the face, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, CASTLE -- NIGHT

Cobb is SMASHED sideways off his feet...

INT. DINING ROOM, CASTLE -- NIGHT

The CEILING CRACKS above Saito- he looks up as a TON of STONE
floods down, CRUSHING HIM and we-
CUT TO::

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM -- DAY

Saito's eyes FLICKER OPEN.  AWAKE.

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Nash SMACKS Cobb again-
NASH: He won't wake!

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Arthur, crouched by Saito, connects the second tube.
ARTHUR: Dunk him!
A CLICK: Arthur looks up to find Saito with a gun to his
head and a finger to his lips, gesturing silence...

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Nash puts his hand on Cobb's forehead and PUSHES HIM BACKWARDS-
as Cobb starts to FALL BACKWARDS in the chair we are in SLO-
MO, and we-
CUT TO:: 11.

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE -- NIGHT

Cobb, full speed, picks himself up, scrambling to read the
last sheet of paper.  He stares at it PUZZLED- bullets hit
around him as the Guards race up the stairs and we-
CUT TO::

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM -- DAY

Cobb, in SLO-MO, hits the WATER- head THRASHING as he goes
under- and we-
CUT TO::

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE -- NIGHT

Cobb glances up from the paper as WATER EXPLODES IN THROUGH
ALL THE WINDOWS FLOODING THE ENTIRE HALL-
COBB IS SWAMPED BY WATER, SPUN IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE- HE
PULLS DEEPER OR FOR THE SURFACE, WE CAN'T TELL...
HE BREAKS THE SURFACE, GASPING FOR AIR IN THE BATHTUB IN THE-

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM -- DAY

Cobb's AWAKE, GULPING AIR, getting his bearings.
Saito SMASHES into the room, KNOCKING Nash down- Cobb LAUNCHES
himself out of the tub, FLYING dripping wet across the room
to SLAM Saito against the door- the gun DROPS, Cobb's fist
CONNECTS with Saito's jaw and the struggle is over.

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Cobb, wet but composed, sits, turning Saito's gun in his
hand.  Nash holds Saito's arms behind him.  Outside, the
sounds of RIOTING are louder.
COBB: You came prepared.
SAITO: I bring the gun because not even my
head of security knows this apartment.
How did you find it?
Arthur, at the window, looks out at the WORSENING VIOLENCE.
COBB: Hard for a man in your position to
keep a love nest totally secret...
particularly when there's a married
woman involved.
SAITO: She would never...
(CONTINUED): 12.
CONTINUED::
COBB: And yet, here we are.
Saito is silent.
COBB (CONT'D): With a dilemma.
SAITO: You got what you came for.
COBB: Not quite.  The key piece of
information wasn't there, was it,
Mr.Saito?
Arthur looks over at Cobb, worried
ARTHUR: They're getting closer, Cobb.
And we-
CUT TO::

INT. BULLET TRAIN - COMPARTMENT -- DAY

Todashi slips a pair of HEADPHONES over Nash's ears, then
pulls out an MP3 player and we-
CUT TO::

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM -- DAY

Saito's eyes are on the floor.
COBB: You held something back because you
knew what we were up to...
Cobb uses the barrel of the gun to raise Saito's chin.
COBB (CONT'D): So why let us in at all?
Saito smiles, defiant.  VIOLENT NOISES echo up the stairway...
SAITO: An audition.
COBB: Audition for what?
SAITO: It doesn't matter.  You failed.
COBB: I extracted all the information you
had in there.
(CONTINUED): 13.
CONTINUED::
SAITO: But your deception was readily
apparent.
And we-
CUT TO::

INT. BULLET TRAIN - COMPARTMENT -- DAY

Todashi opens the SILVER BRIEFCASE, revealing the complex
mechanism of syringes and controllers- FOUR CONTROLLERS
DISPLAY COUNTDOWNS.: Todashi waits for the first countdown to hit 30, then HITS
PLAY on the MP3 player- He watches Nash's sleeping face as
he RAISES the volume...
Through Nash's headphones: the opening bars of Edith Piaf's
"Non, Je ne regrette rien", and we-
CUT TO::

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM -- DAY

In the distant background, strange MASSIVE low-end MUSICAL
TONES start, sounding like DISTANT HORNS...
SAITO: So leave me and go.
COBB: You know the corporation who hired
us won't accept failure.  We won't
last two days...
The DISTANT, SLOWED-DOWN MUSIC is becoming LOUDER, as are
the SHOUTS coming up the stairs.  Arthur looks at his watch,
its SLOW-SECOND TICKING MARKS TIME WITH THE MASSIVE MUSIC.
ARTHUR: Come on, Cobb.
COBB: So now I have to do this the old-
fashioned way-
Cobb GRABS SAITO AND PUTS HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR, gun pressed
into his cheek.  Saito looks into Cobb's eyes- sees he will
pull the trigger.  Saito BLINKS, looks away in shame-
When he NOTICES SOMETHING.  And starts LAUGHING.
SAITO: I've always hated this carpet.
Cobb's eyes flick to the carpet and back.
(CONTINUED): 14.
CONTINUED::
SAITO (CONT'D): It's stained and frayed in such
distinctive ways...
Cobb looks up at Nash, who shrugs, at a loss.
SAITO (CONT'D): But very definitely made of wool.
Right now I'm lying on polyester.
Cobb glares at Nash, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. BULLET TRAIN - COMPARTMENT -- DAY

Todashi watches the first of the countdowns hit ZERO, he
looks up at Arthur, STIRRING, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM -- DAY

Saito turns from the carpet to look up at Cobb.
SAITO: Which means I'm not lying on my
carpet, in my apartment...
(smiles)
You've lived up to your reputation,
Mr.Cobb... I'm still dreaming.
Cobb looks over to Arthur, but ARTHUR HAS VANISHED, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. BULLET TRAIN - COMPARTMENT -- DAY

Arthur's eyes flicker open, AWAKE.  He RIPS at his tubes.
TODASHI: How'd it go?
ARTHUR: Not good.
Arthur checks the remaining three countdowns, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM -- DAY

Saito gets to his feet, looking admiringly at Cobb.
SAITO: A dream within a dream- I'm impressed.
(CONTINUED): 15.
CONTINUED:: Cobb lowers the gun.  Defeated.  Glances at his watch.  The
music REVERBERATES, the RIOTERS BANG ON THE DOOR, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. BULLET TRAIN - COMPARTMENT -- DAY

Arthur retracts the tubes into the case as he watches the
next COUNTDOWN HIT ZERO, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM -- DAY

Another BANG on the door- Saito, confident now, approaches
Cobb.  Nash is behind Saito.
SAITO: But in my dream, we really ought to
be playing by my rules...
NASH: Ah, yes, but you see, Mr.Saito-
Saito turns to Nash-
COBB: We're not in your dream-
Saito turns back to Cobb, BUT COBB HAS VANISHED-
NASH: We're in mine.
Saito SPINS back to Nash- the DOOR SMASHES OFF ITS HINGES AS
RIOTERS POUR INTO THE ROOM, SWARMING OVER NASH...  BUT NASH
IS GONE.  The music DIES.  Saito and the rioters stand there
in the SILENCE, the light DWINDLING... and we-
CUT TO::

INT. BULLET TRAIN - COMPARTMENT -- DAY

Nash's eyes open, AWAKE.
ARTHUR (O.S.): Asshole!
Nash BLINKS.  Arthur is in his face, furious.
ARTHUR (CONT'D): How could you get the carpet wrong?!
NASH: It wasn't my fault!
ARTHUR: You're the architect-
(CONTINUED): 16.
CONTINUED::
NASH: I didn't know he was going to rub
his damn cheek on it!
Cobb PULLS Arthur away from Nash.
COBB: Let's go.
ARTHUR: And you- what the hell was all that?
COBB: I had it under control.
ARTHUR: I'd hate to see out of control-
COBB: There's no time for this- I'm getting
off at Kyoto.
ARTHUR: Why?  He's not gonna search every
compartment.
COBB: I can't stand trains.
Arthur moves to the briefcase.  Turns a dial.
ARTHUR: I can keep him under for one minute-
Arthur hits a button- A PLUNGER DEPRESSES.  Cobb RIPS the
tape off Saito's wrist, ROLLS up his tubes.  Arthur SLAMS
the silver case shut.  Todashi pulls open the door-
COBB: Every man for himself.
Arthur and Nash EXIT, heading in different directions down
the corridor.  Cobb hands Todashi a thick roll of CASH, looks
at Saito, who STIRS.  Cobb moves off.

EXT. JAPANESE COUNTRYSIDE -- CONTINUOUS

The BULLET TRAIN speeds through the lush landscape.

INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Saito WAKES GENTLY.  Looks around the compartment, empty but
for Todashi, reading a comic.  Saito looks down at his wrist.
Sees a small mark.  Rubs it.  SMILES.
16A.:

EXT. TOKYO -- DUSK

Moving over the vast city towards a high rise.  A HELICOPTER
thumps into frame, heading for a pad on the roof.

INT. APARTMENT, TOKYO -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb sits, waiting.  Checks his watch, restless.  He pulls a
HANDGUN.  Checks it is loaded.  Places it on the table in
front of him.  Pulls out a PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on
the table... He INTENTLY STUDIES the top's spin... As he
stares, the sound of a FREIGHT TRAIN builds and builds- the
top WOBBLES, TIPS onto its side- the sound of the train STOPS.
the PHONE RINGS- Cobb GRABS it-
CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
Hi, Daddy!  Hi Dad.
COBB: Hey, guys.  How are you?
(CONTINUED): 17.
CONTINUED:: CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
Good.  Okay, I guess.
Cobb closes his eyes, trying to picture his children: INSERT
CUT: COBB'S MEMORY- a LITTLE BLONDE BOY (3), back towards
us, crouches IN A GARDEN, looks at something in the grass...
COBB: Who's just okay?  Was that James?
JAMES (over phone)
Yeah.  When are you coming home?
COBB: I can't.  Not for a while.
INSERT CUT: A LITTLE BLOND GIRL (5), also FACE UNSEEN, joins
JAMES, CROUCHING BESIDE HIM...
JAMES (over phone)
Why?
COBB: Well, James, like I've told you- I'm
away because I'm working...
LITTLE GIRL (over phone)
Grandma says you're never coming
back.
Cobb pauses.  Takes a breath.  INSERT CUT: James and Philippa,
FACES UNSEEN, lift their heads from the grass, responding to
someone's call- they RUN AWAY FROM US ACROSS THE GARDEN...
COBB: Philippa, can you ask Grandma to
pick up the phone-
PHILIPPA (over phone)
She's shaking her head.
Cobb TENSES, as if about to SMASH the phone.
COBB: Well, we'll just have to hope
Grandma's wrong about that won't we?
JAMES (over phone)
Daddy?
COBB: Yes?
JAMES (over phone)
Is Mommy with you?
Cobb looks like he just got punched- INSERT CUT: COBB'S MEMORY-
MAL, WIND BLOWING HER HAIR, SMILES CALMLY...
(CONTINUED): 18.
CONTINUED: (2):
COBB: No.  No, we talked about this, James.
Mommy's gone.
JAMES (over phone)
Where?
GRANDMA'S VOICE (over phone)
Time to go, kids.  Say bye-bye-
COBB: I'll give some presents to Grandpa,
okay?  Just be good for-
Cobb STARES at the dead phone.  Then DOWNS his drink- A KNOCK
at the door.  Cobb GRABS the top, the gun- MOVES to the door-
cracks it: Arthur.
ARTHUR: Our ride's on the roof.
Cobb nods.  Moves to pick up his bag.  Arthur watches.
ARTHUR (CONT'D): Cobb... are you okay?
Cobb looks up.
COBB: Yeah, why?
ARTHUR: Down in the dream... Mal showing up
like that...
COBB: Yeah.  I'm sorry about your leg.
ARTHUR: It's getting worse, isn't it?
COBB: One apology's all you're getting,
Arthur.  Now, where's Nash?
ARTHUR: Hasn't shown.  Wanna wait?
COBB: (shakes head)
We were supposed to deliver Saito's
expansion plans to Cobol Engineering
two hours ago.  By now they know we
failed.  Time to disappear.
18A.:

INT. CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Arthur head towards the elevator.
ARTHUR: Where will you go?
COBB: Buenos Aries.  I can lie low there.
Maybe sniff out a job when things
quiet down.  You?
ARTHUR: Stateside.
COBB: (wistful)
Course.  Send my regards.
Arthur looks at Cobb.  Nods.  Sympathetic.
19.

EXT. ROOFTOP HELIPAD -- NIGHT

The HELICOPTER sits, ROTORS SPINNING.  As Cobb and Arthur
reach the door, it SLIDES OPEN.  Cobb steps up into the
leather-padded interior.  He freezes:

INT. HELICOPTER ON PAD -- CONTINUOUS

Nash, BEATEN BLOODY, sits on the far side, slumped against
the window.  Beside him: SAITO.  He nods politely at Cobb.
SAITO: He sold you out.  Thought to come to
me and bargain for his life...
Saito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN.
SAITO (CONT'D): So I offer you the satisfaction.
COBB: That's not how I deal with things.
SAITO: Would you work with him again?
Cobb shakes his head.  Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the
chopper.  Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit.  The chopper
RISES.  Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad.
COBB: What will you do to him?
SAITO: Nothing.  But I can't speak for your
friends from Cobol Engineering.
Saito looks out at the city slipping by.
COBB: What do you want from us?
SAITO: Inception.
Arthur raises his eyebrows.  Cobb is poker-faced.
SAITO (CONT'D): Is it possible?
ARTHUR: Of course not.
SAITO: If you can steal an idea from
someone's mind, why can't you plant
one there instead?
(CONTINUED): 20.
CONTINUED::
ARTHUR: Okay, here's planting an idea: I say
to you, "Don't think about elephants".
(Saito nods)
What are you thinking about?
SAITO: Elephants.
ARTHUR: Right.  But it's not your idea because
you know I gave it to you.
SAITO: You could plant it subconsciously-
ARTHUR: The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea.  True
inspiration is impossible to fake.
COBB: No, it isn't.
SAITO: Can you do it?
COBB: I won't do it.
SAITO: In exchange, I'll give you the
information you were paid to steal.
COBB: Are you giving me a choice?  Because
I can find my own way to square things
with Cobol.
SAITO: Then you do have a choice.
COBB: And I choose to leave.

EXT. AIRFIELD -- MOMENTS LATER

The helicopter sets down next to a PRIVATE JET.

INT. HELICOPTER -- CONTINUOUS

Saito indicates the plane.
SAITO: Tell the crew where you want to go,
they'll file the plan en route.
Cobb and Arthur look at each other.  Then move for the door.
(CONTINUED):
21A.:
CONTINUED::
ARTHUR: I know how much you want to go home-
COBB: (sharp)
No, you don't.
ARTHUR: But this can't be done.
COBB: It can.  You just have to go deep
enough.
ARTHUR: You don't know that-!
(CONTINUED): 22.
CONTINUED: (2):
COBB: I've done it before.
Arthur is taken aback.  Cobb turns to the window.
ARTHUR: Did it work?
COBB: (quiet)
Yes.
ARTHUR: Who did you do it to?
Cobb looks at Arthur.  Closed.  Arthur shrugs.
ARTHUR (CONT'D): So why are we headed to Paris?
COBB: We're going to need a new architect.

INT. GREAT HALL, ECOLE ARCHITECTURAL -- MORNING

Cobb, carrying a shopping bag, looks into a lecture hall: no
students, just a RUMPLED PROFESSOR hunched over paperwork.

INT. LECTURE HALL -- CONTINUOUS

COBB (O.S.): You never did like your office.
PROFESSOR MILES looks up, squinting.  Recognizes Cobb.
MILES: No space to think in that broom
cupboard.
Cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows.
MILES (CONT'D): Is it safe for you to be here?
COBB: Extradition between France and the
U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare.
MILES: I think they'd find a way to make it
work in your case.
Cobb hand Miles the shopping bag.
COBB: Can you take these back for the kids?
(CONTINUED): 23.
CONTINUED::
MILES: It'll take more than the occasional
stuffed animal to convince those
children they still have a father.
COBB: I know.  I thought you could talk to
Marie about bringing them on vacation.
Somewhere I could meet-
MILES: Why would she listen to me?
COBB: You were married for twenty years.
MILES: She blames me as much as you.
COBB: Doesn't she understand that my kids
need me-?
MILES: Yes, she does.  We all do.  Go back
and face the music, Dom.  Explain
what Mal did.
COBB: Be realistic, Stephen.  They'd never
understand- they'd lock me up and
throw away the key.  Or worse.
MILES: You think what you're doing now is
helping your case?
COBB: Lawyers don't pay for themselves.
This is what I have.  This is what
you taught me.
MILES: I never taught you to be a thief.
COBB: No, you taught me to navigate other
people's minds.  But after what
happened with Mal there weren't a
whole of legitimate ways for me to
use that skill.
Miles looks at Cobb.
MILES: Why did you come here, Dom?
Cobb shifts slightly.
(CONTINUED):
23A.:
CONTINUED: (2):
COBB: I found a way home.  A job.  For
powerful people.  If I pull it off I
can get back to my family.  But I
need help.
Miles realizes something.
MILES: My god.  You're here to corrupt one
of my brightest and best.
COBB: If you have someone good enough, you
have to let them decide for themselves-
you know what I'm offering-
MILES: Money?
COBB: No, not just money- the chance to
build cathedrals, entire cities-
things that have never existed, things
that couldn't exist in the real
world...
MILES: Everybody dreams, Cobb.  Architects
are supposed to make those dreams
real.
(CONTINUED): 24.
CONTINUED: (3):
COBB: That's not what you used to say.
You told me that in the real world
I'd be building attic conversions
and gas stations.  You said that if
I mastered the dream share I'd have
a whole new way of creating and
showing people my creations.  You
told me it would free me.
Miles looks at Cobb, sad.
MILES: And I'm sorry.  I was wrong.
COBB: No, you weren't.  Your vision was a
vision of pure creativity.  It's
where we took it that was wrong.
MILES: And now you want me to let someone
else follow you into fantasy.
COBB: They won't actually come on the job,
they'll just design the levels and
teach them to the dreamers.
MILES: Design them yourself.
COBB: Mal won't let me.
Miles looks at Cobb.  Appalled.
MILES: Come back to reality, Dom.  Please.
COBB: You want to know what's real, Stephen?
Your grandchildren waiting for their
dad to come back.  This job- this
last job- is how I get there.
Miles looks down, fiddles with his papers.
COBB (CONT'D): I wouldn't be standing here if there
were any other way.  I can get home.
But I need an architect who's as
good as I was.
Miles looks Cobb in the eye.  Decides.
MILES: I've got someone better.
25.

INT. CORRIDOR -- LATER

Miles and Cobb stand by as STUDENTS file out of a lecture.
MILES: Ariadne...
A young woman carrying books turns.  This is ARIADNE.
MILES (CONT'D): I'd like you meet Mr.Cobb.
She sizes him up with quick eyes.  Offers her hand.
ARIADNE: Pleased to meet you.
MILES: If you have a few moments, Mr.Cobb
has a job offer to discuss with you.
ARIADNE: A work placement?
COBB: (smiles)
Not exactly.

EXT. ROOFTOP, ECOLE ARCHITECTURE -- MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Paris.  She
unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of GRAPH
PAPER and a PEN.  He offers them.  She bites her sandwich.
COBB: A test.
ARIADNE: (mouth full)
Aren't you going to tell me anything?
COBB: Before I describe the job, I have to
know you could do it.
ARIADNE: Why?
COBB: It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
Ariadne raises her eyebrows.
COBB (CONT'D): You have two minutes to draw a maze
that takes me one minute to solve.
Ariadne takes the pad and pen.  Cobb looks at his watch.
(CONTINUED): 26.
CONTINUED::
COBB (CONT'D): Go.
She starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze.
COBB (CONT'D): Stop.
Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb.  He glances at the
pad, then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution.  She
is taken aback.  Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad back.
COBB (CONT'D): Again.
She traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING...
COBB (CONT'D): Stop.
She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased.  Cobb solves the
puzzle instantly, as before.  Her smile falls.
COBB (CONT'D): You'll have to-
She GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it
over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of the back.
Cobb watches, surprised.  He smiles as he sees that she's
drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings.
Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant.  Cobb takes the pen,
starts the maze.  This time he gets stuck.  Nods.
COBB (CONT'D): (working the maze)
More like it.

EXT. NARROW STREET, PARIS -- DAY

Arthur stops at a warehouse door.  Consults a piece of paper.

INT. WORKSHOP -- CONTINUOUS

A large, dusty warehouse.  The SLIDING DOOR cracks open.
Arthur enters.  Looks around, approvingly.

INT. SAME -- LATER

Arthur DRAGS LAWN CHAIRS into the middle of the room.  He
erects a table.  Lays out several SILVER CASES, unpacking
them, laying out lines of tubing, MECHANISMS...

EXT. PARISIAN CAFE -- DAY

Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table.
(CONTINUED): 27.
CONTINUED::
COBB: They say we only use a fraction of
the true potential of our brains...
but they're talking about when we're
awake.  While we dream the mind
performs wonders.
ARIADNE: Such as?
COBB: How do you imagine a building?  You
consciously create each aspect,
puzzling over it in stages...   But
sometimes, when your imagination flies-
ARIADNE: I'm discovering it.
COBB: Exactly.  Genuine inspiration.
Cobb leans forward and draws on the paper table cloth.
COBB (CONT'D): In a dream your mind continuously
does that...
Cobb has drawn a circle of two arrows.
COBB (CONT'D): It creates and perceives a world
simultaneously.  So well that you
don't feel your brain doing the
creating.  That's why we can short-
circuit the process...
ARIADNE: How?
COBB: By taking over the creating part.
Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows.
COBB (CONT'D): This is where you come in.  You build
the world of the dream.  We take the
subject into that dream, and let him
fill it with his subconscious.
(CONTINUED): 28.
CONTINUED: (2):
ARIADNE: But are you trying to fool him that
the dream is actually real life?
COBB: (nods)
While we're in there, we don't want
him to realize he's dreaming.
ARIADNE: How could I ever get enough detail
to convince him that it's real?
COBB: Our dreams feel real while we're in
them.  It's only when we wake up we
realize things were strange.
Ariadne gestures around them-
ARIADNE: But all the textures of real life-
the stone, the fabric... cars...
people... your mind can't create all
this.
COBB: It does.  Every time you dream.  Let
me ask you a question- you never
remember the beginning of your dreams,
do you?  You just turn up in the
middle of what's going on.
ARIADNE: I guess.
COBB: So...  how did we end up at this
restaurant?
ARIADNE: We came here from...
Ariadne trails off, confused.
COBB: How did we get here?  Where are we?
Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember.  A FAINT RUMBLE begins.
ARIADNE: Oh my God.  We're dreaming.
Cobb nods.  The RUMBLE is BUILDING.
(CONTINUED): 29.
CONTINUED: (3):
COBB: Stay calm.  We're actually asleep in
the workshop.  This is your first
lesson in shared dreaming, remember?
Ariadne looks around, mind REELING.  Cobb BRACES-
The restaurant VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTS, EXPLODING AND IMPLODING
PARTICLES OF FURNITURE, WALLS, PEOPLE FLYING AROUND- Ariadne
WONDERS at the MAYHEM WHIRLING around them- Cobb SHIELDS his
head against the debris.  She sees him-
ARIADNE: (shouting over noise)
If it's just a dream, why are you
covering your-
Ariadne is WIPED FROM HER SEAT BY A MASSIVE BLAST and we-
CUT TO::

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Ariadne JOLTS awake.
COBB (O.S.): Because it's never just a dream.
Ariadne turns to Cobb's voice.  They are both sitting in the
lawn chairs.  Arthur watches over them.
COBB (CONT'D): And a face full of glass hurts like
hell, doesn't it?  While we're in
it, it's real.
ARTHUR: That's why the military developed
dream sharing- a training program
where soldiers could strangle, stab
and shoot each other, then wake up.
ARIADNE: How did architects get involved?
COBB: Someone had to design the dreams.
(to Arthur)
Let's go another five minutes-
ARIADNE: We were only asleep for five minutes?
We talked for an hour at least...
COBB: When you dream, your mind functions
more quickly, so time seems to pass
more slowly.
(CONTINUED):
29A.:
CONTINUED::
ARTHUR: Five minutes in the real world gives
you an hour in the dream.
COBB: Let's see how much trouble you can
cause in five minutes.
And we-
CUT TO:: 30.

EXT. SAME PARISIAN STREET -- DAY

Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb.  Cobb looks
around at the street, the cafe, approving.
COBB: It's good.  You've got the cafe, the
layout... you forgot the book shop
but pretty much everything else is
here.
Ariadne looks at the passers-by.
ARIADNE: Who are the people?
COBB: They're projections of my
subconscious.
ARIADNE: Yours?
COBB: Sure- you are the dreamer, I am the
subject.  My subconscious populates
your world.  That's one way we get
at a subject's thoughts- his mind
creates the people, so we can
literally talk to his subconscious.
ARIADNE: How else do you do it?
COBB: Architecture.  Build a bank vault or
a jail, something secure, and the
subject's mind will fill it with
information he's trying to protect.
ARIADNE: Then you break in and steal it.
COBB: Exactly.
Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.
ARIADNE: I love the concrete sense of things-
(stamps foot)
Real weight, you know?  I thought a
dream space would be all about the
visual, but it's the feel of things.
Question is, what happens as you
start to mess with physics...
(CONTINUED):
30A.:
CONTINUED:: She CONCENTRATES on the street.  The street starts to BEND
IN HALF- the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they
form the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING
INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE.  Ariadne looks up (or down) at
the people on the opposite city surface.  Cobb watches her
excitement.
ARIADNE (CONT'D): It's something, isn't it?
COBB: (quiet)
Yes.  It is.
(CONTINUED): 31.
CONTINUED: (2): As they walk Ariadne notices more and more of the projections
STARING at her.
ARIADNE: Why are they looking at me?
COBB: Because you're changing things.  My
subconscious feels that someone else
is creating the world.  The more you
change things the quicker the
projections converge on you.
ARIADNE: Converge?
COBB: They feel the foreign nature of the
dreamer, and attack- like white blood
cells fighting an infection.
ARIADNE: They're going to attack us?
COBB: Just you, actually.
They walk along the street to where it joins the next
gravitational plane.  They step up onto the different plane
and walk down the street towards a river.  As Ariadne
approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads
Cobb up onto a small jetty.  As she concentrates, pillars
emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty.
They step on to it as it grows.  Cobb is impressed.
COBB (CONT'D): It's beautiful... but if you keep on
changing things...
People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne.  Several of
them BUMP her shoulder as they pass.
ARIADNE: Mind telling your subconscious to
take it easy?
COBB: That's why it's called subconscious.
I don't control it.
The bridge now spans the Seine.  Cobb marvels at it.
COBB (CONT'D): Arched stone, iron pillars... it's...
Cobb pauses, thinking.  Remembering.
(CONTINUED):
31A.:
CONTINUED: (3): INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling,
laughing.  He smiles back.  They are on the same bridge.
COBB (CONT'D): I know this bridge.  This place is
real-
(serious)
You didn't imagine it, you remembered
it...
(CONTINUED): 32.
CONTINUED: (4):
ARIADNE: (nods)
I cross it every day on my way to
the college.
COBB: Never recreate places from your
memory.  Always imagine new places.
ARIADNE: You have to draw from what you know-
COBB: (tense)
Use pieces- a streetlamp, phonebooths,
a type of brick- not whole areas.
Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude...
ARIADNE: Why not?
COBB: Because building dreams out of your
own memories is the surest way to
lose your grip on what's real and
what's a dream.
ARIADNE: Did that happen to you?
Cobb says nothing.  He stands there, staring at Ariadne.
PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile.
COBB: Look, this isn't about me-
Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him-
(CONTINUED): 33.
CONTINUED: (5):
ARIADNE: Is that why you need me to build
your dreams?
A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder-
COBB: Leave her alone-
More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her
arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away-
Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd
towards the helpless Ariadne- it is Mal.  She approaches
with even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy.
ARIADNE: Wake me up, Cobb.
As Mal walks she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE-
COBB: Mal, no!
ARIADNE: Wake me up!
Ariadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we-
CUT TO::

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Ariadne WAKES, BREATHING HARD.  Arthur moves to her-
ARTHUR: It's okay.
ARIADNE: Why couldn't I wake?
ARTHUR: The only way to wake from inside the
dream is to die.
Cobb, in the lawn chair opposite, PULLS his tubes out.
COBB: She'll need a totem.
ARIADNE: What?
ARTHUR: Some kind of personal icon.  A small
object that you can always have with
you, and that no-one else knows.
(CONTINUED): 34.
CONTINUED:: Cobb gets to his feet.  Ariadne stares at him, furious.  He
heads to the bathroom.
ARIADNE: That's some subconscious you've got,
Cobb.
(calls after him)
She's a real charmer!
ARTHUR: Sounds like you've met Mrs.Cobb.
ARIADNE: (surprised)
She's his wife?
Arthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes.
ARTHUR: So.  A totem.  You need something
small, potentially heavy...

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb takes out his PEWTER SPINNING TOP.  SPINS it on the
marble counter...

INT. WORKSHOP -- CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks at Arthur, puzzled.
ARIADNE: Like a coin?
ARTHUR: Too common.  You need something that
has a weight or movement that only
you know.

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb STUDIES the spin of the top as it decays, becoming more
and more ECCENTRIC...

INT. WORKSHOP -- CONTINUOUS

ARIADNE: What's yours?
Arthur holds out a DIE.
ARTHUR: A loaded die.
Ariadne reaches for it- Arthur snatches it away-
(CONTINUED): 35.
CONTINUED::
ARTHUR (CONT'D): I can't let you handle it.  That's
the point.  No one else can know the
weight or balance of it.
ARIADNE: Why?
ARTHUR: So when you examine your totem...

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb's spinning top WOBBLES OVER.
ARTHUR (O.S.): You know, beyond a doubt, that you're
not in someone else's dream.
Cobb GRABS it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline.

INT. WORKSHOP -- CONTINUOUS

Ariadne thinks this over.
ARIADNE: That's not an issue for me.
ARTHUR: Why not?
ARIADNE: Arthur, maybe you can't see what's
going on, maybe you don't want to.
But Cobb's got problems he's tried
to bury down there.  I'm not going
to open my mind to someone like that.
Ariadne gets to her feet.  Walks away.
COBB (O.S.): She'll be back.
Arthur turns.  Cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway.
COBB (CONT'D): I've never seen anyone pick it up so
fast.  And one reality won't be enough
for her now.  When she comes back
get her building mazes.
ARTHUR: Where will you be?
COBB: I've got to talk to Eames.
(CONTINUED): 36.
CONTINUED::
ARTHUR: Eames?  But he's in Mombasa.  Cobol's
back yard.
COBB: Necessary risk.
ARTHUR: There are plenty of other thieves.
COBB: We don't just need a thief.  We need
a forger.

INT. GAMBLING DEN, MOMBASA -- DAY

Crowded, bustling, smoke-filled.  A westerner (40's), shabby
suit, is squeezed in at a dice game.  This is EAMES.  He
FIDDLES with his last two chips.
COBB (O.S.): Rub them against each other all you
like, they're not going to breed.
Eames looks up to see Cobb.
EAMES: You never know.
Eames tosses down his last chips.  The dice are rolled...
COBB: Drink?
Eames loses.
EAMES: You're buying.
Cobb follows Eames.  Eames mysteriously produces two stacks
of chips and puts them down in front of the cashier.  Cobb
pulls one off the top, squints at the embossed name.
COBB: Your spelling hasn't improved.
Eames GRABS the chip.  Hands it to the cashier.
EAMES: Piss off.
COBB: How's your handwriting?
Eames takes his money.  Smiles at Cobb.
EAMES: Versatile.
37.

EXT. STREET, MOMBASA -- CONTINUOUS

Eames leads Cobb down the quiet street
EAMES: Word is, you're not welcome in these
parts.
COBB: Yeah?
EAMES: There's a price on your head from
Cobol Engineering.  Pretty big one,
actually.
COBB: You wouldn't sell me out.
Eames looks at Cobb, offended.
EAMES: 'Course I would.
COBB: (smiles)
Not when you hear what I'm selling.

EXT. BALCONY OF A COFFEE HOUSE -- LATER

A ramshackle balcony overlooking a busy street.  Eames pours.
COBB: Inception.
Eames's glass stops halfway to his mouth.
COBB (CONT'D): Don't bother telling me it's
impossible.
EAMES: It's perfectly possible.  Just bloody
difficult.
COBB: That's what I keep saying to Arthur.
EAMES: Arthur?  You're still working with
that stick-in-the-mud?
COBB: He's a good point man.
EAMES: The best.  But he has no imagination.
(MORE):
(CONTINUED): 38.
CONTINUED::
EAMES (CONT'D): If you're going to perform inception,
you need imagination.
COBB: You've done it before?
EAMES: Yes and no.  We tried it.  Got the
idea in place, but it didn't take.
COBB: You didn't plant it deep enough?
EAMES: It's not just about depth.  You need
the simplest version of the idea-
the one that will grow naturally in
the subject's mind.  Subtle art.
COBB: That's why I'm here.
EAMES: What's the idea you need to plant?
COBB: We want the heir to a corporation to
break up his father's empire.
EAMES: See, right there you've got various
political motivations, anti-
monopolistic sentiment and so forth.
But all that stuff's at the mercy of
the subject's prejudice- you have to
go to the basic.
COBB: Which is?
EAMES: The relationship with the father.
(downs drink)
Do you have a chemist?
Cobb shakes his head.
EAMES (CONT'D): There's a man here.  Yusuf.  He
formulates his own versions of the
compounds.
COBB: Let's go see him.
(CONTINUED): 39.
CONTINUED: (2):
EAMES: Once you've lost your tail.
(Cobb reacts)
Back by the bar, blue tie.  Came in
about two minutes after we did.
COBB: Cobol Engineering?
EAMES: They pretty much own Mombasa.
Cobb glances over the balcony.
COBB: Run interference.  We'll meet
downstairs in half an hour.
EAMES: Back here?
COBB: Last place they'd expect.
Eames downs his drink.  Rises.  Walks over to the Businessman.
EAMES: Freddy!
The Businessman looks up, awkward.
EAMES (CONT'D): Freddy Simmonds, it is you!
Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING HARD into
the midst of the crowd on the street below.
EAMES (CONT'D): (looks harder)
Oh.  No, it isn't.
The Businessman looks past Eames but Cobb has vanished.

EXT. STREET, MOMBASA -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb stands up, PUSHES into the crowd- faces PEER at him- he
moves, trying to blend- TURNS- a SECOND BUSINESSMAN is there.
COBB: (disarming smile)
Yes?
SECOND BUSINESSMAN: We need to-
Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him-
(CONTINUED): 40.
CONTINUED:: The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake,
DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight
passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals...
He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables...
the First Businessman enters, spots him.  An AFRICAN MAN
gets in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb
considers his options... The First Businessman DRAWS A GUN-
Cobb bolts, steps up on a table and out an open window,
SCRAMBLING into the alley outside...
Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED
alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END.  Faces in the CROWD
start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks
back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS
DRAWN-: Cobb sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow
end- he THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY...
The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to
SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as
his pursuers gain YARDS...  the Crowd is upon him- he BURSTS
FREE, TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight.
Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square.  TWO MORE
BUSINESSMEN move towards him.  Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS
UP, BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK.
SAITO: Care for a lift, Mr.Cobb?
COBB: (jumping in)
What brings you to Mombasa, Mr.Saito?
SAITO: I have to protect my investment.

EXT. COFFEE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Eames stands on the pavement.  The car pulls up.  Cobb beckons
from the rear window.  Eames looks at Saito.  Back to Cobb.
EAMES: This is your idea of losing a tail?
COBB: (shrugs)
Different tail.

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Arthur sits at the table, working on a mechanism.  A small
COUGH prompts him to look up: Ariadne is there.
ARTHUR: He said you'd be back.
(CONTINUED):
40A.:
CONTINUED::
ARIADNE: I tried not to come.
ARTHUR: But there's nothing else quite like
it.
(CONTINUED):
41-41A.:
CONTINUED: (2):
ARIADNE: No paper, no pens... nothing between
you and raw, direct creation.
Arthur picks up his mechanism.
ARTHUR: Shall we take a look at paradoxical
architecture?
Ariadne nods, takes off her coat and we-
CUT TO::

INT. PENROSE STEPS -- LATER

Arthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass
and steel ATRIUM in an office complex.
ARTHUR: You're going to have to master a few
tricks if you're going to build three
complete dream levels.
A SECRETARY DROPS some papers as they pass...
ARIADNE: What sort of tricks?
They take a tight turn and continue down the next flight.
ARTHUR: In a dream, you can cheat architecture
into impossible shapes.  That lets
you create closed loops, like the
Penrose Steps.  The infinite
staircase.
Ariadne FREEZES- THEY ARE IN THE EXACT SPOT THEY STARTED
DESCENDING FROM, next to the Secretary gathering her papers.
Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs.
ARTHUR (CONT'D): See...
Arthur stops her gently- they are on the highest step, with
a LARGE DROP to the next step.  Arthur gestures at the drop.
ARTHUR (CONT'D): Paradox.  A closed loop like this
helps you disguise the boundaries of
the dream you've created.
ARIADNE: How big do the levels have to be?
(CONTINUED): 42.
CONTINUED: (2):
ARTHUR: Anything from the floor of a building,
to an entire city.  But it has to be
complicated enough for us to hide
from the projections.
ARIADNE: A maze.
ARTHUR: And the better the maze-
ARIADNE: The longer we have before the
projections catch us.
Ariadne looks around.  Sees people LOOKING at Arthur.
ARIADNE (CONT'D): My subconscious seems polite enough.
ARTHUR: You wait, they'll turn ugly.  No one
likes to feel someone else messing
around in their mind.
ARIADNE: Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
ARTHUR: I don't know if he can't, but he
won't.  He thinks it's safer if he
doesn't know the layouts.
ARIADNE: Why?
ARTHUR: He won't tell me.  I think it's Mal.
I think she's getting stronger.
ARIADNE: His ex-wife?
ARTHUR: She's not his ex.
ARIADNE: They're still together?
(CONTINUED): 43.
CONTINUED: (3): Arthur turns to Ariadne.  Gentle.
ARTHUR: No.  No, she's dead, Ariadne.  What
you see in there is just his
projection of her.
ARIADNE: What was she like in real life?
ARTHUR: (quiet)
She was lovely.
CUT TO::

EXT. ROOFTOP, OLD TOWN, MOMBASA -- DAY

Saito deposits a FILE in front of Cobb: PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS.
As Cobb runs through them he passes them to Eames.
SAITO: Robert Fischer, 32.  Heir to the
Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.
He's spent his whole life being
groomed as successor- breaking up
his father's empire will take a
radical shift in his thinking.
COBB: What's your problem with Fischer?
SAITO: That's not your concern.
COBB: This isn't the usual corporate
espionage, Mr.Saito.  This is
inception.  The seed of the idea we
plant will grow in this man's mind.
It'll change him.  It might even
come to define him.
Saito looks at Cobb.
SAITO: My sources suggest you might not
have always been so cautious.
COBB: Then you need new sources, Mr.Saito.
(CONTINUED): 44.
CONTINUED:: Saito considers Cobb.  Shrugs.
SAITO: Fischer Morrow has the regulators in
their pockets.  We're the last company
standing between them and total energy
dominance and we can no longer
compete.  Soon they'll control the
energy supply of half the world.
They'll be able to blackmail
governments, dictate policy.  In
effect, they become a new superpower.
The world needs Robert Fischer to
change his mind.
EAMES: That's where we come in.  How's Robert
Fischer's relationship to his father?
SAITO: Rumor is the relationship is
complicated.
COBB: We'll need more than rumor, Mr.Saito.
Eames picks up a photo: a distinguished executive (68).
EAMES: Can you get me access to him?
Browning.  Fischer senior's right
hand man.  Fischer junior's godfather.
SAITO: It should be possible.  If you can
get the right references.
EAMES: References are something of a
specialty for me, Mr.Saito.

EXT. DECREPIT BUILDING, MOMBASA -- LATER

Eames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a doorway.
45.

INT. STAIRWELL -- CONTINUOUS

Peeling paint, buzzing flies.  They ascend to a dusty, wire-
reinforced glass door which Eames pushes open-

INT. PHARMACY -- CONTINUOUS

Row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty
glass bottles of all shapes and colors.  At the far end, a
portly forty-year-old man rises from behind his desk,
beckoning.  This is YUSUF.
YUSUF: Come, come.
Eames shakes Yusuf's hand.  Yusuf stops at Cobb.
YUSUF (CONT'D): Ah, yes.  Mr.Cobb.  I've heard so
very much about you.
(indicates chairs)
Please.
Yusuf chases a CAT off Saito's chair.
YUSUF (CONT'D): Bloody cats.
Yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass
bottles.  None of them has a label.
YUSUF (CONT'D): You work using Somnacin, I think,
Mr.Cobb?
COBB: You're well informed, Mr.Yusuf.
Yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb.
COBB (CONT'D): (dubious)
Somnacin?
YUSUF: (proudly)
Yusuf's Somnacin.
Yusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's nose.
COBB: As good as the real thing?
Yusuf WHIPS the bottle away from Cobb, offended.
YUSUF: Better.
(CONTINUED): 46.
CONTINUED:: Yusuf holds the bottle to the light, marvelling.
YUSUF (CONT'D): Binds the dreamers tight.  Let's
them dream as one.  Makes it real.
Of course, if you'd prefer, you could
use Somnacin brand.  If you could
explain to the international control
council what you wanted it for.
Yusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf.  Sits.
YUSUF (CONT'D): You are seeking a chemist?
(Cobb nods)
To formulate compounds for a job?
COBB: And to come into the field with us.
YUSUF: I rarely go into the field, Mr.Cobb.
COBB: We need you there to tailor compounds
to our particular requirements.
YUSUF: Which are?
COBB: Great depth.
YUSUF: A dream within a dream?  Two levels?
COBB: Three.
YUSUF: Not possible.  That many dreams within
dreams would be too unstable.
COBB: I've done it before.  You just have
to add a sedative.
YUSUF: A powerful sedative.  How many team
members?
COBB: Five.
(CONTINUED): 47.
CONTINUED: (2):
SAITO: Six.
(to Cobb)
The only way to know you've done the
job is if I go in with you.
COBB: There's no room for tourists on these
jobs, Mr.Saito.
SAITO: This time, it would seem there is.
Cobb looks at him, uneasy.  Yusuf pulls out another bottle.
YUSUF: Of course.  I use it every day.
Yusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid inside.
COBB: For what?
Yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL
DOOR.  He STOPS- second thoughts.
YUSUF: Perhaps... you will not want to see.
Cobb motions to continue.  Yusuf pulls out a large key.

INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY -- CONTINUOUS

A dark room with ROWS of low COTS.  Each with a sleeping
occupant.  Tubes connect their wrists.  An  ELDERLY BALD MAN
watches over them.
EAMES: (counting)
Eighteen, twenty- all connected,
bloody hell.
YUSUF: They come every day.  To share the
dream.
Yusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to the nearest
bed.  Reaches out to the OCCUPANT.  Gives his face a FIRM
SLAP.  The sleeper does not even stir.
YUSUF (CONT'D): See?  Very stable.
COBB: How long do they dream?
YUSUF: Three, four hours.  Every day.
(CONTINUED): 48.
CONTINUED::
COBB: How long in dream time?
YUSUF: With this compound... about forty
hours.  Each and every day.
Saito surveys the room, appalled.
SAITO: Why do they do it?
YUSUF: Tell him, Mr.Cobb.
COBB: After a while...
(looks at Saito)
It becomes the only way you can dream.
YUSUF: Do you still dream, Mr.Cobb?
Cobb STARES at the sleepers.  Uneasy.
EAMES: They come here every day to sleep?
ELDERLY BALD MAN (O.S.)
No.
Cobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondly at his
dreamers.
ELDERLY BALD MAN (CONT'D)
They come to be woken up... the dream
has become their reality...
The Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb's chest.
ELDERLY BALD MAN (CONT'D)
And who are you to say otherwise?
Cobb STARES at the Elderly Bald Man.  DISTURBED.  Cobb turns
to Yusuf.  TOSSES him the bottle.
COBB: Let's see what you can do.

INT. SAME -- MOMENTS LATER

Cobb is lying on an empty cot, asleep.  Yusuf stands over
him.  As we move in on Cobb's SLEEPING FACE we hear the sound
of a FREIGHT TRAIN, BUILDING, and we-
CUT TO:: 49.

EXT. WASTELAND -- DAY

CLOSE ON Cobb's face as he lies, EYES CLOSED, cheek pressed
to a METAL RAIL- THE SOUND OF THE TRAIN IS DEAFENING- Cobb
is BREATHING, BREATHING, BREATHING, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY -- DAY

Cobb's eyes open.  Yusuf is watching him.
YUSUF: Sharp, no?
Cobb nods.  Gets to his feet, looking around-

INT. BATHROOM, YUSUF'S SHOP -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb SPLASHES water on his face, breathing hard- INSERT CUT: A CURTAIN BILLOWS.  MAL TURNS TO US, HAIR BLOWING, SMILING.
Cobb fumbles in his pockets, pulls out his spinning top.  He
tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink, but
it FALLS to the floor and rolls towards the door- Saito is
there.  WATCHING Cobb.  He looks down at the spinning top.
SAITO: Everything alright, Mr.Cobb?
Cobb dries his face with a paper towel.  Picks up his top.
COBB: Everything's fine.
88A:

INT. BACK ROOM, WORKSHOP -- NIGHT

Close on a small BRASS CHESS PIECE.  Ariadne tips it over.
Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on
the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base.  Tests
the TIPPING POINT again.  A NOISE makes her look up.
88B:

INT. WORKSHOP -- CONTINUOUS

Ariadne comes into the main space.  Someone is there,
unpacking one of the MECHANISMS.  Cobb.
ARIADNE: You're back.
Cobb looks up with a start.  Caught out.
ARIADNE (CONT'D): Are you going under on your own?
COBB: I just- I need to test some things.
I didn't realize anyone was here.
(CONTINUED):
49A.:
88B:
CONTINUED::
88B:
ARIADNE: Just working on my totem.
Ariadne holds up the chess piece.  Cobb reaches for it.
COBB: Let me see-
Ariadne SNAPS it out of his reach.  Smiles.  Cobb nods.
COBB (CONT'D): You're learning.
ARIADNE: It's an elegant solution to keeping
track of reality.  Your invention?
COBB: No.  Mal's.
Cobb pulls out his spinning top.  Looks at it.
COBB (CONT'D): This one was hers.  She'd spin it in
a dream and it would never topple.
Just spin and spin...
ARIADNE: Arthur told me she died.
COBB: She did.  How are the mazes coming?
Ariadne indicates three large ARCHITECTURAL MODELS.
ARIADNE: Good.  Each level relates to the
part of the subject's subconscious
we're trying to access.  I'm making
the bottom level a hospital, so that
Fischer will bring his father there-
COBB: Don't tell me.  Remember, you only
want the dreamer to know the layout.
ARIADNE: Why's that so important?
COBB: In case one of us brings in part of
our subconscious.  You wouldn't want
any projections knowing the layout-
ARIADNE: In case you bring Mal in.
Cobb says nothing.
(CONTINUED):
49B.:
88B:
CONTINUED: (2):
88B:
ARIADNE (CONT'D): You won't build yourself because if
you know the maze, then she knows
it.  And she'd sabotage the operation.
You can't keep her out, can you?
Cobb says nothing.
ARIADNE (CONT'D): Do the others know?
COBB: No.
ARIADNE: You have to warn them if it's getting
worse-
COBB: (gentle)
I didn't say it's getting worse.
Look, Ariadne, I need them for this
job.  I need you for this job.
Without your help I'll never get
back to my children.  And that's all
I can care about right now.
ARIADNE: Why can't you go home, Cobb?
Cobb looks at her, deciding what to say.
COBB: They think I killed her.
ARIADNE: How did she die?
Cobb thinks.
INSERT CUT: Mal, wind BLOWING her hair, smiles at Cobb.  Now
we see Cobb- SHAKING HIS HEAD, TEARS STREAMING, BEGGING-
COBB: Thank you.
ARIADNE: For what?
COBB: Not asking whether I did.

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Ariadne, Arthur, Yusuf, Eames and Saito sit around the room,
looking at FILES.  Cobb presides.
(CONTINUED):
49C.:
CONTINUED::
COBB: The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to
the Australian energy conglomerate,
Fischer Morrow.
Cobb opens a large presentation pad.
COBB (reads aloud) (CONT'D)
"I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S EMPIRE"
Cobb turns to the team.
COBB (CONT'D): An idea Robert Fischer's conscious
mind would never accept.  We have to
plant it deep in his subconscious.
ARTHUR: How deep?
COBB: Three levels down.
ARTHUR: A dream within a dream within a dream?
Is that even possible?
COBB: Yes.  It is.
(CONTINUED): 50.
CONTINUED: (2):
COBB (CONT'D): Now, the subconscious motivates
through emotion, not reason, so we
have to translate the idea into an
emotional concept.
ARTHUR: How do you translate a business
strategy into an emotion?
COBB: That's what we have to figure out.
Robert and his father have a tense
relationship.  Worse, even, than the
gossip columns have suggested...
EAMES: Do you play on that?  Suggest breaking
up his father's company as a 'screw
you' to the old man?
COBB: No.  Positive emotion trumps negative
emotion every time.  We yearn for
people to be reconciled, for
catharsis.  We need positive emotional
logic.
Eames thinks.  Paces.  Looking back at the board.
EAMES: Try this...  "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT
I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT
FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS".
COBB: That might work.
ARTHUR: Might?  We'll have to do better than
that.
EAMES: Thanks for the contribution, Arthur.
ARTHUR: Forgive me for wanting a little
specificity, Eames.
COBB: Inception's not about specificity.
When we get inside his head, we're
going to have to work with what we
find.
Arthur shrugs, frustrated.  And we-
CUT TO::
51-51A.:

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS -- DAY

The team are in the middle of a DESERTED intersection.
Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography.
EAMES: We could split the idea into emotional
triggers, and use one on each level.
COBB: How do you mean?
EAMES: On the top level, we open up his
relationship with his father... say-
"I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY FATHER'S
FOOTSTEPS".  Next level down we've
accessed his ambition and self-esteem.
We feed him- "I WILL CREATE SOMETHING
MYSELF".  Then, the bottom level, we
bring out the emotional big guns...
COBB: "MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE
HIM".:
(CONTINUED): 52.
CONTINUED: (2):
EAMES: That could do it.
ARTHUR: How do you produce these emotional
triggers?
EAMES: I forge each emotional concept in
the style and manner of Peter
Browning, a key figure in Fischer's
emotional life.
Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view.
ARTHUR: Are those yours?
Eames shakes his head.  Cobb turns to Yusuf.
ARTHUR (CONT'D): Yusuf?
YUSUF: Yup.  Sorry.
COBB: Suppress them.  We don't bring our
own projections into the dream- we
let Fischer's subconscious supply
the people.
EAMES: Saito, when do I get to see Browning?
SAITO: You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday.
We've arranged for you to spend
several days...

INT. ANTE ROOM, MAURICE FISCHER'S OFFICE -- DAY

Eames sits in the crowded room.  Boxes and files are piled
high.  Browning stands by a pair of double doors.
SAITO (V.O.): ...as part of a consulting litigation
team working for Browning.
BROWNING: I'm not smelling settlement here- we
take them down.
LAWYER: Mr.Browning, Maurice Fischer's policy
is always one of avoiding litigation-
Browning turns to the lawyer.  Calm, but POWERFUL.
(CONTINUED):
52A-52B.:
CONTINUED::
BROWNING: Shall we relay your concerns directly
to Maurice?
Browning opens the doors to Maurice Fischer's inner office.
Eames leans in to watch as Browning beckons the lawyer into-

INT. MAURICE FISCHER'S INNER OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

The office is a MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL ROOM: a BED where the
desk should be.  Browning addresses a figure at the window.
ROBERT FISCHER, 30's, abstracted.
BROWNING: How is he?
(CONTINUED): 53.
CONTINUED: (2): Fischer turns to Browning.  Motions silence, as he glances
at his FATHER in the bed.  Wheezing gently.
BROWNING (CONT'D): I don't want to bother him
unnecessarily but I know he-
FATHER: Robert!  I've told you to keep out
the damn!-
MAURICE LASHES OUT, KNOCKING things from his bedside table.
A NURSE calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve a FRAMED
PHOTOGRAPH.  He looks at the photo through the broken glass-
a YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each
of the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on it.
BROWNING: Must be a cherished memory of his-
FISCHER: I put it by his bed.  He hasn't even
noticed.
BROWNING: Robert, we have to talk about a power
of attorney.  I know this is hard
for you, but it's important that we
start to think about the future-
FISCHER: Not now, Uncle Peter.
Browning looks at Fischer, considering.  Biding his time.
EAMES (V.O.): The vultures are circling.  The sicker
Maurice Fischer becomes, the stronger
Peter Browning becomes...
Eames WATCHES Browning, STUDYING his every move.

INT. BATHROOM -- DAY

Eames gestures at a mirror, as if offering to shake hands...
EAMES (V.O.): I've had time to learn Browning's
physical presence and mannerisms...
In the mirror: BROWNING GESTURES BACK.

INT. WORKSHOP -- CONTINUOUS

EAMES: Now, in the dream, I can impersonate
Browning and suggest the concepts to
Fischer's conscious mind...
(MORE):
(CONTINUED): 54-55.
CONTINUED::
EAMES (CONT'D): (Eames draws a diagram)
Then we take Fischer down another
level and his own subconscious feeds
it right back to him.
ARTHUR: (impressed)
So he gives himself the idea.
EAMES: Precisely.  That's the only way to
make it stick.  It has to seem self-
generated.
ARTHUR: Eames, I'm impressed.
EAMES: Your condescension, as always, is
much appreciated, Arthur.

CUT TO::

INT. DESERTED HOTEL LOBBY -- DAY

The team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby, debating.
Ariadne is showing Arthur the lobby.
EAMES: He's not scheduled for surgery, no
dental, nothing.
COBB: I thought he had some knee thing?
EAMES: Nothing they'd put him under for.
Besides we need a good ten hours.
SAITO: Sydney to Los Angeles.
(CONTINUED): 57.
CONTINUED:: They turn to Saito.
SAITO (CONT'D): Twelve hours and forty-five minutes-
one of the longest flights in the
world.  He makes it every two weeks...

EXT. AIRFIELD -- DAY

Fischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the
tarmac towards a GULFSTREAM JET, accompanied by two aides.
COBB (V.O.): Surely he flies private?
SAITO (V.O.): Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.
Fischer is met at the steps by a DISTRAUGHT FLIGHT OFFICER.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- DAY

Cobb chews this over.  Arthur comes over.
ARTHUR: It'd have to be a 747.
COBB: Why?
ARTHUR: On a 747 the pilots are up above,
first class is in the nose so nobody
walks through the cabin.  We'd have
to buy out the whole cabin, and the
first class flight attendant-
SAITO: We bought the airline.
Everyone turns to Saito.
SAITO (CONT'D): It seemed... neater.
COBB: Neater, huh?
(gets to his feet)
Well, now we have ten uninterrupted
hours.
(to Ariadne)
Nice lobby, by the way.
And we-
CUT TO:: 58.

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

The group is back in the workshop, deep in discussion.
ARTHUR: My question is how we go down three
layers with enough stability.  Three
layers down a little turbulence is
gonna translate into an earthquake.
The dreams are gonna collapse with
the slightest disturbance.
Yusuf clears his throat.
(CONTINUED):
58A.:
CONTINUED::
YUSUF: Sedation.  For sleep stable enough
to create three layers of dreaming...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB -- DAY

Yusuf depresses a plunger.  Arthur is SLEEPING in a chair.
YUSUF (V.O.): We will have to combine it with an
extremely powerful sedative....
Eames SLAPS Arthur, HARD.  Arthur does not stir.

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Arthur unconsciously rubs his cheek.
YUSUF: The compound we'll be using to share
the dream is an advanced Somnacin
derivative.  It creates a  very clear
connection between dreamers, whilst
actually accelerating brain function.
COBB: Buying us more time in each level.
YUSUF: Brain function in the dream will be
about twenty times normal.  And when
you go into a dream within that dream
the effect is compounded.
ARIADNE: How much time?
YUSUF: Three dreams... that's ten hours,
times twenty, times twenty, times
twenty...
EAMES: Maths was never my strong suit.
COBB: It's basically a week one layer down,
six months two layers down-
ARIADNE: And ten years in the third level.
Who wants to spend ten years in a
dream?
YUSUF: Depends on the dream.
(CONTINUED):
58B.:
CONTINUED::
EAMES: It's not going to take us long to
crack Fischer open once we get going.
We'll be out in a couple days, max.
ARTHUR: How do we get out once we've made
the plant?
(to Cobb)
I hope you've got something a little
more elegant in mind than shooting
me in the head like last time.
Arthur tilts back in his chair.  Yusuf turns to Cobb.
COBB: A kick.
ARIADNE: What's a kick?
(CONTINUED): 59.
CONTINUED: (2): Eames slips his foot under Arthur's chair leg.  TIPS it-
Arthur's legs SHOOT UP INSTINCTIVELY for balance-
EAMES: That, Ariadne, would be a kick.
COBB: That feeling of falling which snaps
you awake.  We use that to jolt
ourselves awake once we're done.
ARTHUR: But how are we going to feel that
through the sedation?
YUSUF: That's the clever part.  I customize
the sedative...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB -- DAY

Cobb, Eames and Yusuf watch Arthur, ASLEEP, in a chair.
YUSUF (O.S.): To leave inner ear function
unimpaired...
Yusuf, with a wicked grin, slowly TIPS Arthur's chair
backwards... as he falls, Arthur's body JERKS, EYES OPENING
just before he HITS the floor.

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Arthur thinks, nodding slowly.
YUSUF: That way, however deep the sleep,
the sleeper will still feel falling...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB -- DAY

Yusuf gleefully LEANS a SLEEPING ARTHUR to one side...
YUSUF (V.O.): Or tipping...
Arthur goes down with a CRASH, JERKING AWAKE-

INT. WORKSHOP -- DAY

Arthur thinks this through.
ARTHUR: Even that won't cut through three
layers of deep sleep.
(CONTINUED):
59A.:
CONTINUED::
COBB: The trick is to devise a kick for
each level, then synchronize them to
get a snap that penetrates all three
layers.
Arthur looks at Cobb, getting it.
(CONTINUED): 60.
CONTINUED::
ARTHUR: We can use the musical countdown to
synchronize the different kicks.

INT. WORKSHOP -- NIGHT

Ariadne comes into the darkened main space.  Cobb is lying
on one of the chairs, asleep.  Plugged into the mechanism.
Ariadne stands over him.  Watching.
(CONTINUED): 61.
CONTINUED:: She opens the case, PULLS one of the tubes, sits, checking
the dials as she injects the needle cap into her arm, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR -- DAY

Ariadne ascends.  She looks at the buttons.  Spots the "B".
The elevator STOPS.  She looks through the grill at-

INT. YOUNG GIRL'S BEDROOM -- DAY

Ariadne pulls back the grill and walks across the room,
considering the dusty furnishings.  At the window is a dolls
house, front slightly ajar.  Ariadne opens it.  Inside is a
SAFE.  She tries it.  LOCKED.  A NOISE STARTLES her- she
turns, looking through a doorway into another room...
108A:
108A:

INT. LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks into the room to see Cobb and Mal talking,
arguing.  A private moment.  Mal brushes at Cobb's hair,
trying to convince him.  We hear snatches of conversation-
MAL: You remember when you asked me to
marry you?
COBB: Of course...
MAL: You said you had a dream...
COBB: That we'd grow old together.
MAL: And we can.  You know how to find
me... you know what you have to do.
Cobb is shaking his head, gently.  Mal looks into Cobb's
eyes- gentle, loving... Mal SPOTS Ariadne spying on them.
FREEZES, staring, hostile.  Cobb turns, sees Ariadne, moves
towards her, leaving Mal.
COBB: You shouldn't be in here.
Cobb guides her back into the elevator.
ARIADNE: I wanted to know what "tests" you
need to do on your own every night.
61A.:
108B:
108B:

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR -- DAY

Cobb shuts the CAGE DOOR.  Ariadne hits a button.  The
elevator RISES.  Through the GRILL Ariadne can see a BEACH
stretching off into the distance.  The elevator stops.  Mal
sits on the sand.  Beside her, the two children are crouched,
away from us, building a SAND CASTLE.
ARIADNE: Why do you do this to yourself?
(CONTINUED):
61B.:
108B:
CONTINUED::
108B:
COBB: This is the only way I can still
dream.
ARIADNE: Is it so important to dream?
Cobb stares at his family.
COBB: In my dreams... we're still together.
The kids, WITHOUT TURNING AROUND, jump up and RUN AWAY.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS

The elevator descends.
ARIADNE: But these aren't just dreams, are
they?  They're memories.  You said
never to use memories.
COBB: And I shouldn't.
ARIADNE: You're keeping her alive.
COBB: No.
ARIADNE: You can't let her go.
COBB: No.  These are moments I regret.
Moments I turned into dreams so I
could change them.
Ariadne's fingers move across the buttons- stop at the 'B'-
ARIADNE: What've you got buried down there
that you regret?
Cobb pushes her hand away.  Hits the 3rd floor button.
COBB: There's only one thing I need you to
understand about me...

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne follows Cobb into the kitchen.  A THIN MAN is there,
standing by the table.  He holds a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER.
(CONTINUED): 62.
CONTINUED::
ARIADNE: This is your house?
COBB: Mine and Mal's.
ARIADNE: Where is she?
COBB: She'd already died.
The Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper.  A CHILD'S SHOUT-
Cobb TURNS.  Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden.  A small
blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to
look at something on the ground.
COBB (CONT'D): It's James.  My boy.  He's found
something.  Maybe a worm.
A slightly older girl RUNS into view.
COBB (CONT'D): And there's Philippa.
She crouches beside the boy.  Their FACES ARE AWAY FROM US.
They point and discuss whatever is on the ground.
COBB (CONT'D): I thought about calling out, so they'd
turn and smile those incredible
smiles... but I'm out of time-
The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.
THIN MAN: Right now.  Or never, Cobb.
Cobb nods, turns from the window-
COBB: Then I panic that I'll always wish
I'd seen them turn, that I can't
waste this chance...
Cobb TURNS BACK to call out- but the children RACE OFF...
COBB (CONT'D): But the moment's passed.  And whatever
I do, the dream's always the same...
When I'm about to call...  they run.
(CONTINUED): 63.
CONTINUED: (2): Cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, FACES UNSEEN.
COBB (CONT'D): If I'm going to see their faces again-
I've got to get back here in the
real world...
Behind him, Ariadne SLAMS the grill shut.  Cobb TURNS.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS

Ariadne hits the BASEMENT button.  The elevator starts to
DESCEND.  Ariadne STARES, fascinated as glimpses of floors
slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wall of
freight train...  The elevator STOPS.  Through the grill
Ariadne sees a HOTEL SUITE.  She pulls open the grill, steps
cautiously out into-
64.

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE -- CONTINUOUS (NOW NIGHT)

DISHEVELED bedclothes, UPENDED room service table,
STRAWBERRIES across the floor.  A STRUGGLE.  Ariadne steps
forward- SMASH- she looks down to see that she has kicked
over a CHAMPAGNE FLUTE.  Ariadne feels a draught.  The CURTAIN
BILLOWS.:
MAL (O.S.): What are you doing here?
Ariadne TURNS.  Mal is there.
ARIADNE: My name is-
MAL: I know who you are.  What are you
doing here?
ARIADNE: I don't know.  Trying to understand.
MAL: How could you understand?  Do you
know what it is to be a lover?  To
be half of a whole?
ARIADNE: No.
Mal moves slowly towards Ariadne...
MAL: I'll tell you a riddle.  You're
waiting for a train.  A train that
will take you far away.  You know
where you hope this train will take
you, but you don't know for sure...
Mal glides around Ariadne, looking her over.
MAL (CONT'D): But...  it doesn't matter.  How can
it not matter to you where that train
will take you?
COBB (O.S.): Because you'll be together.
Cobb is standing in the elevator.  Mal nods.  Looks at him.
MAL: How could you bring her here, Dom?
ARIADNE: What is this place?
(CONTINUED):
64A-64B.:

COBB: A hotel.  We spent our anniversaries
in this suite.
ARIADNE: What happened here?
Mal picks up the BROKEN STEM of a champagne flute...

Cobb PULLS Ariadne into the elevator- Mal THROWS herself
towards Ariadne- Cobb SLAMS the GRILL- Mal SMASHES against
it AGAIN and AGAIN like a WILD ANIMAL- Ariadne FLINCHES-
MAL: YOU PROMISED!  YOU SAID WE'D BE
TOGETHER!-:
COBB: We can.  We will.  But I need you to
stay here for now-
MAL: YOU SAID WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER-!
Cobb pushes a button and the elevator starts to rise.
COBB: I'll come back.  I need you to stay
here on your own for now.  Just while
I do this job.  Then we can be
together-
MAL: WE'LL BE TOGETHER- YOU PROMISED!-
Mal THROWS herself against the grill, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. WORKSHOP -- NIGHT

Ariadne watches Cobb sleeping.  His eyes gradually flicker
open.  He sees her watching him.
ARIADNE: You think you can just build a prison
of memories to lock her in?  You
think that's going to contain her?
The LIGHTS COME ON: Saito and Arthur stand in the doorway.
SAITO: Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
COBB: When's the funeral?
SAITO: Thursday.  In Los Angeles.
COBB: Robert'll accompany the body Tuesday
at the outside.  We have to move.
Cobb gets up.  Ariadne comes over to him.

ARIADNE: (low)
I'm coming with you.
COBB: No.  I promised Miles.

ARIADNE: The team needs someone in there who
understands what you're struggling
with.  If you don't want it to be me
then you need to show Arthur what I
just saw.
Cobb looks at Ariadne.  Turns to Saito.
COBB: We need one more seat on the plane.

INT. DEPARTURE GATE, SYDNEY -- DAY

Saito stands looking out the window at a 747.  Cobb arrives
beside him.  They watch a COFFIN being loaded.
COBB: If I get on this plane and you haven't
taken care of things... when we land
I go to jail for the rest of my life.
SAITO: Complete the job en route, I make
one phone call from the plane...
you will have no trouble clearing
immigration.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 -- CONTINUOUS

The luxurious cabin has only ten seats.  Cobb finds his-
sees Ariadne in the seat behind his.  They do not acknowledge
each other.  Behind her is Arthur, looking out the window.
Eames enters, STUFFS his bag into the overhead bin, BLOCKING
the passenger behind: ROBERT FISCHER, standing there, patient,
bag in hand, wearing black.
EAMES: Oh, sorry.
(CONTINUED): 67.
CONTINUED:: Eames SQUEEZES up against his seat to let Fischer BRUSH PAST.
Fischer moves to his seat, directly in front of Cobb.  Eames
TOSSES Cobb a PASSPORT.  Cobb flips it open: Fischer's.
Pockets it.  Yusuf and Saito enter, take their seats.

EXT. RUNWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

The 747 HURTLES down the runway.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 -- MOMENTS LATER

Cobb looks down at his hand: a TINY VIAL taped to the center
of his palm.  He removes the cap.  The seatbelt sign goes
dark.  Cobb unbuckles, stands.
COBB: Excuse me?
Fischer looks up.
FISCHER: Yes?
COBB: I think this is yours...
Cobb holds up the open passport, comparing the picture to
Fischer.  Fischer's hand goes to his pocket.  Cobb hands
Fischer the passport.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you gentlemen care for a drink?
FISCHER: Water.
COBB: Same.
Fischer gives Cobb a thin smile.  Holds up his passport.
FISCHER: Well, thank you.
COBB: No problem.  Look, I couldn't help
noticing your name.  You're not
related to Maurice Fischer?
Fischer takes a beat.  But Cobb seems harmless.
FISCHER: Actually, he was my father.
COBB: I'm very sorry for your loss.  He
was an inspiring figure.
(CONTINUED): 68.
CONTINUED:: The Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them.
COBB (CONT'D): Thanks.
As he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand... a CLEAR
LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him.
COBB (CONT'D): To Maurice Fischer.
(they drink)
I'll leave you in peace.
Fischer grants him a smile.

EXT. 747 -- LATER

The great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 -- MOMENTS LATER

Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall
onto Fischer's head-  Fischer doesn't flinch.  ASLEEP.  Cobb
SIGNALS the others.  The First Flight Attendant unlocks a
CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain.
Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHANISM CASE.
Cobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed
them around the window side of each of the seats.  Arthur
rolls up Fischer's cuff- PUSHES the needle cap into Fischer's
wrist.  Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes
behind the armrest of Fischer's seat.
Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne.  Cobb puts the case on
Yusuf's lap.  Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the syringes.
The others recline their seats.  Yusuf HITS A BUTTON- closes
the case- places it at his feet.  He settles back, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. SEDAN -- DAY

Cobb DRIVES.  Saito and Arthur are in the back.  Rain BEATS
down.  Cobb pulls over-

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

Yusuf stands on the corner, silver briefcase in hand, collar
turned up against the rain.  He reaches for the door.

INT. SEDAN -- CONTINUOUS

Yusuf clambers into the back, brushing rain from his face.
ARTHUR: (indicates rain)
Couldn't you have peed before you
went under?
(CONTINUED): 69.
CONTINUED::
YUSUF: Sorry.
The front door OPENS and Eames climbs in, soaked.
EAMES: Bit too much free champagne before
takeoff, Yusuf?
YUSUF: Ha bloody ha.
COBB: At least we know he'll be looking
for a cab in this.

INT./EXT. SEDAN ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic.  He weaves around
several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB.
COBB: Brace yourselves.
Cobb hits the gas- REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH.  The
CABDRIVER gets out, fuming.  Heads to Cobb's window-
CABDRIVER: Hey, asshole!  Why don't you try
driving without your thumb up-
He sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly.
COBB: Walk away.
The Cabdriver backs off.  Arthur climbs into the cab.  Both
cars pull away.

INT./EXT. CAB ON RAINY NEW YORK STREET -- CONTINUOUS

Arthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the
pedestrians.  He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign.
Fischer FLAGS him down.  Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing
rain from his shoulders.
FISCHER: Third and market.  Snappy.
Eames JUMPS in from the other side.
FISCHER (CONT'D): What're you doing?
EAMES: Sorry, I thought it was free.
(CONTINUED): 70.
CONTINUED::
EAMES (CONT'D): Maybe we could share.
FISCHER: Maybe not.
Saito gets into the front passenger seat.  Pointing a gun.
FISCHER (CONT'D): Great.
Arthur pulls away.  Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses
it at Eames.
FISCHER (CONT'D): (contemptuous)
There's 500 dollars in there.  And
the wallet's worth more than that.
For that you ought to at least drop
me at my stop.
Eames smiles at this.
EAMES: I'm afraid-
A SHOT SHATTERS the window by Eames' head- another SHOT
IMPACTS by Saito-
EAMES (CONT'D): Get us out of here!
Arthur hits the gas, but a BLACK S.U.V. SKIDS sideways in
front, BLOCKING the path-
A BLOCK BEHIND- Cobb is at a light.  ARIADNE is getting in
the front.  Cobb has HEARD the GUNFIRE-
COBB: Come on-!
Cobb looks ahead to the AMBUSH, hits the gas- the sedan
ROCKETS forward... but BAM- A FREIGHT TRAIN CLIPS THE FRONT
OF THE SEDAN, SHOVING IT SIDEWAYS AS AN ENDLESS TRAIN BARRELS
PAST, A WALL BETWEEN COBB AND THE AMBUSH-
A SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY
MEN advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab.
Bullets RIP into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of
Fischer, PULLING a SACK over his head-
Inside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing-
ARIADNE: This wasn't in the design-
Cobb BACKS UP, SPINS around, heading for the tail of the
train-
(CONTINUED):
70A.:

AUTOMATIC RIFLE- he steps towards the cab through the rain,
raises his weapon and BLASTS THE CAB'S WINDSCREEN-
(CONTINUED): 71.
CONTINUED: (3): Cobb clears the end of the train, and SKIDS across the tracks-
Arthur CROUCHES down- PUSHES the accelerator with his HAND-
YANKS the wheel- FLYING BLIND.  The cab NAILS the Security
Man, CRUNCHING into the front S.U.V.-
Cobb SMASHES his car into the rear S.U.V., creating a GAP-
Arthur YANKS the transmission and REVERSES- SCRAPING through
the gap- Security Men DIVE out of the way- Arthur throws a
ragged J-turn to head down a SIDE STREET- Cobb follows in
the other car.  Rain whips across Arthur's face as he BREATHES-
ARTHUR: Everybody okay?  Saito?
Arthur looks at Saito.  Saito's hand is at his belly.  Covered
in BLOOD.

EXT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

The sedan and cab pull into the side entrance- Eames jumps
out- PULLS the shutter down behind them-

INT. WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Yusuf and Eames PULL Fischer from the cab, HUSTLING him
through a doorway.  Cobb JUMPS out of the sedan, furious.
COBB: Arthur!  Arthur what the-
Arthur pulls the bloody Saito from the front seat.
COBB (CONT'D): Oh, Christ.  Is he dying?
ARTHUR: I don't know.  What happened back
there?  Where were you?
COBB: We were blocked by a freight train.
ARTHUR: (to Ariadne)
Why would you put a train crossing
in a downtown intersection?
ARIADNE: I didn't.
COBB: (snaps)
Why were we all ambushed, Arthur!?
Those weren't regular projections-
they'd been trained!
(CONTINUED):
71A.:
CONTINUED::
ARIADNE: How could they be trained?
ARTHUR: Fischer's had an extractor teach his
mind to defend itself.  His
subconscious is militarized.  It
should've shown on the research-
COBB: So why the hell didn't it!?
ARTHUR: Calm down.
COBB: Don't tell me to calm down- you were
meant to check Fischer's background
thoroughly.  You can't make this
kind of mistake- we're not prepared
for this kind of violence-
ARTHUR: Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security
before.  We just have to be more-
COBB: This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur!
(points at Saito)
He's dying!
EAMES (O.S.): So we put him out of his misery.
Eames steps into the room, pulls his gun and moves over Saito.
COBB: No.
EAMES: He's in agony.  Let's wake him up-
Cobb GRABS Eames' arm.
COBB: No!
(they lock eyes)
It won't wake him up.
EAMES: What do you mean, it won't wake him?
When you die in a dream you wake up.
YUSUF: Not from this.  We're too heavily
sedated to wake up that way.
Eames looks at Yusuf, then to Cobb.
(CONTINUED):
71B.:
CONTINUED: (2):
COBB: If he... or any one of us dies...
that person doesn't wake up.  Their
mind drops into limbo.
ARIADNE: Limbo?
ARTHUR: Unconstructed dream space.  Raw,
infinite subconscious.  Nothing there
but what was built by anyone on the
team who's been trapped there before.
Arthur looks at Cobb.
ARTHUR (CONT'D): On this team... just Cobb.
Eames moves to Cobb.  Looks him in the eye.
EAMES: Great.  So now we're stuck in
Fischer's mind battling it out with
his private army, and if we get hit
we're stuck in limbo till our brains
dissolve into scrambled egg?
Cobb says nothing.  Saito groans more loudly
ARTHUR: Let's just get him upstairs.

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Saito is laid out on an old desk.  Arthur examines him.  He
motions to Ariadne.  Eames watches Cobb.
ARTHUR: Hold this.  Firm pressure.
Arthur turns to Cobb.
ARTHUR (CONT'D): You knew the risks and you didn't
tell us.
COBB: There wasn't meant to be any risk.
We weren't supposed to be dealing
with a load of gunfire.
ARTHUR: You had no right.
COBB: It's the only way you can go three
layers deep, Arthur.
(CONTINUED):
71C.:
CONTINUED:: Arthur turns to Yusuf, hostile.
ARTHUR: And you.  You went along with this?
YUSUF: I trusted him.
ARTHUR: You trusted him?  When?  When he
promised you half his share?
YUSUF: (offended)
No!  His whole share.  Plus, he told
me he'd done it before.
Arthur turns to Cobb.
ARTHUR: Oh, yeah?  With Mal?  That worked
out great, didn't it, Cobb?
Cobb grabs Arthur.
(CONTINUED):
71D-71E.:
CONTINUED: (2):
COBB: You don't know anything about that.
This was the only way to do this
job, Arthur.  I did what I had to do
to get back to my children.
EAMES: So you led us into a war zone with
no way out.
COBB: We have a way out.  The kick.  We
just have to push on, do the job as
fast as possible and get out using
the kick.
EAMES: Forget it.  We go any deeper, we
just raise the stakes.  I'm sitting
it out on this level.
COBB: You'll never make it, Eames.
Fischer's security is surrounding
this place as we speak.  The ten
hours of the flight is a week at
this level- you'll never make it
without getting killed.  Downwards
is the only way forwards.  We have
to carry on.
Saito groans.  Cobb looks at him-
COBB (CONT'D): And we have to do it fast.
Eames and Arthur weigh this up.
COBB (CONT'D): Eames, go get ready.  Arthur, let's
get in there and soften him up.
72.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE -- LATER

Cobb and Arthur wearing BALACLAVAS, PULL the sack from
Fischer's head.  He is chained to the radiator.
FISCHER: I'm insured against kidnapping up to
ten million- this'll be simple-
(CONTINUED): 73.
CONTINUED::
COBB: No, it won't.
Fischer looks at Cobb, unnerved.
ARTHUR: In your father's office, below the
bookshelves, is his personal safe.
We need the combination.
FISCHER: I never noticed a safe-
COBB: Doesn't mean you don't know the
combination.
FISCHER: Well, I don't.
ARTHUR: We have it on good authority that
you do.
FISCHER: Whose?

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Yusuf looks through Fischer's wallet.  Eames is opening a
HINGED, THREE-WING MIRROR.:
YUSUF: Five hundred dollars, this cost?
EAMES: What's inside?
YUSUF: Cash, cards, ID... and this-
Yusuf holds up a SNAPSHOT: the photo from Maurice Fischer's
office- YOUNG ROBERT holds his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his FATHER
blows on it.  Eames takes it from Yusuf.  STUDIES it.  Cobb
enters.  Eames hands him the snapshot.
EAMES: Useful?
Cobb studies the snapshot.  Eames examines himself in the
hinged mirror from multiple angles: ONE BY ONE the myriad
Eames reflections BECOME BROWNINGS.  Cobb pockets the photo.
COBB: You're on.  You've got an hour.
(CONTINUED):
73A.:
CONTINUED::
EAMES: An hour?  I was supposed to have all
night to crack him.
COBB: And Saito was supposed to keep his
guts on the inside.  You've got an
hour- get something we can use.
Eames turns from the mirror AS BROWNING.  He glances at his
watch, then SCREAMS, as if begging for mercy-
74.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Browning's CRY reverberates- Fischer looks up, concerned-
FISCHER: What's that?
ARTHUR: Good authority.
Another cry rings out.  Fischer recognizes the voice.
FISCHER: Uncle Peter?!  Make them stop-
ARTHUR: The combination.
FISCHER: I don't know it!
ARTHUR: Why would Browning tell us you did?
FISCHER: Let me talk to him- I'll find out.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Cobb pushes Browning(Eames),bloody and bruised, into the room
and forces him down next to Fischer.
COBB: You've got an hour.  Get talking.
Cobb cuffs Browning to the sink and Cobb and Arthur leave.
BROWNING(EAMES): They've had me for two days.  They've
got someone with access to your
father's office and they're trying
to open his safe- they thought I'd
know the combination, but I don't-
FISCHER: Neither do I, Uncle Peter.
BROWNING: (confused)
Maurice told me that after he passed
only you would be able to open it.
FISCHER: He never gave me the combination.
Browning thinks for a minute.  Realizes something.
(CONTINUED): 75.
CONTINUED::
BROWNING: He did, he just didn't tell you that
it was a combination.
FISCHER: What, then?
BROWNING: Something only you would know.  Some
meaningful combination of numbers
from your experiences with Maurice-
FISCHER: We didn't have a lot of meaningful
experiences together.
BROWNING: Perhaps after your mother died...
FISCHER: After my mother died, I went to him
in my grief.  You know what he told
me?  "There's really nothing to be
said, Robert".
BROWNING: He always had a hard time with
emotional-
FISCHER: I was eleven, Uncle Peter.
Browning/Eames takes this in.
BROWNING: He loved you, Robert.  In his way.
FISCHER: "In his way"?  At the end he called
me to his deathbed.  He could barely
speak, but he took the trouble to
say one last thing to me.  He pulled
me close... I could make out only
one word.  "Disappointed".
Browning can say nothing.

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls off his balaclava.  Looks down at Saito, who is
breathing fast, shallow.
COBB: How's he doing?
ARIADNE: He's in a lot of pain.
(CONTINUED): 76.
CONTINUED:: Cobb takes Saito's hand.  Looks him in the eye.
COBB: When we get you down to the next
level, the pain will be less intense.
Saito nods, breathing hard.
ARIADNE: (low)
And if he dies?
COBB: His conscious mind will drop out of
the dream.  He'll be trapped in limbo
for a lifetime...
ARIADNE: What will that do to him?
Cobb looks at her.  Grave.
COBB: When he wakes... his mind could be
completely gone.
SAITO: When... when we wake I will still
honour our arrangement...
Cobb looks down at Saito sadly.
COBB: Saito-San, when you wake you might
not even remember that we had an
arrangement.  You'll have forgotten
this world.  Limbo will be your
reality.  Lost there so long, you'll
have become an old man...
SAITO: Filled with regret?
COBB: Waiting to die alone.  Yes.
SAITO: Then I'll take the chance and come
back.  And we'll be young men together
again.
Saito smiles weakly.  Cobb nods at him, turns to Ariadne.
ARIADNE: When were you trapped in limbo?
Cobb says nothing.  Ariadne pulls him away from Saito.
(CONTINUED):
76A.:
CONTINUED: (2):
ARIADNE (CONT'D): Cobb, you might have convinced the
rest of this team to carry on with
the job.  But they don't know the
truth.
COBB: What truth?
ARIADNE: The truth that at any minute you
might bring a freight train through
the wall.  The truth that Mal is
bursting up through your subconscious.
The truth that as we go deeper into
Fischer, we're also going deeper
into you- and I'm not sure we're
going to like what we find there.
Cobb stares back at Ariadne.  Saying nothing.
ARIADNE (CONT'D): This is not just about Fischer, it's
about you.  Tell me what happened to
you and Mal.  Trapped in limbo.
Cobb looks at her.  Thinking it through.
COBB: We were on a job.  Exploring dreams
within dreams.  But we didn't
understand how your mind can turn
hours into years.  How you can get
trapped.  Trapped so deep that when
you wash up on the shore of your
subconscious...
INSERT CUT: MAL LIES ON THE SAND, STARING UP AT A CLOUDLESS
SKY, WAVES WASHING OVER HER...
COBB (CONT'D): You can lose track of what's real.
ARIADNE: How long were you stuck?
Cobb pauses before he answers.  Looks at Ariadne.
COBB: Fifty years.
Ariadne stares at him, incredulous.
ARIADNE: How did you stand it?
INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL BUILD A SAND CASTLE ON THE BEACH...
(CONTINUED): 77.
CONTINUED: (3):
COBB: We built.  We created a whole world
for ourselves...
INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL WALK THROUGH A DESERTED CITY.
COBB (CONT'D): It's not so bad at first, being Gods.
The problem is knowing that it's not
real.  It became impossible for me
to live like that.
ARIADNE: But not for her?
COBB: She accepted it.  At some point...
INSERT CUT::

INT. MAL'S CHILDHOOD HOME -- DAY

Mal opens a DOLL'S HOUSE.  Inside is a SAFE.  She opens it-
it is empty.  She pulls out her SPINNING TOP.
(CONTINUED):
77A.:

COBB (V.O.): ...she'd decided to forget that our
world wasn't real.
Mal places the top inside the safe.  LOCKS IT AWAY...
77B-77C.:

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

ARIADNE: And when you finally woke up?
COBB: To wake from that.  From decades
lived.  To be old souls thrown back
into youth.  It was hard.  At first
Mal seemed okay.  But I started to
realize something was wrong.  Finally
she admitted it.  This idea she was
possessed by.  This simple little
idea that changed everything...
ARIADNE: What was it?
(CONTINUED): 78.
CONTINUED::
COBB: That our world was not real.  No
matter what I did, no matter what I
said, she was convinced that we were
still in a dream.  That we needed to
wake up again...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN -- DAY(FLASHBACK)

Cobb is trying to calm Mal, who is hysterical.
COBB (V.O.): That to get home we'd have to kill
ourselves.

INT. OFFICE,WAREHOUSE -- DAY

Ariadne looks at Cobb, appalled.
ARIADNE: What about your children?
Cobb has to look away.
COBB: She... she believed they weren't
real.  That our real children were
waiting.  Somewhere above...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN -- DAY(FLASHBACK)

Mal shakes her head at Cobb as he USHERS the children out of
the room, FACES UNSEEN-
COBB: Calm down, Mal-
MAL: They're projections, Dom. Your dreams.
I'm their mother- don't you think I
can tell the difference?
Cobb closes the door- turns to her, eyes full of bitter tears.
COBB: If it's my dream then why can't I
control it?  Why can't I stop this?
MAL: (it's obvious)
You don't know you're dreaming.
COBB: You keep telling me I am-
MAL: And you don't believe me!
(CONTINUED): 79.
CONTINUED::
COBB (V.O.): She was certain.  But she loved me
too much to go without me.  So she
made a plan...

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT(FLASHBACK)

Cobb walks along, checking door numbers against a key.
COBB (V.O.): For our anniversary...

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE -- CONTINUOUS(FLASHBACK)

Cobb enters the lavish suite.  He notices the DISHEVELED
BEDCLOTHES.  He steps forward- SMASH- he has tipped over a
champagne glass with his foot...  dinner for two is SPREAD
ACROSS THE FLOOR.  He looks at the DEBRIS, confused... next
to the broken glass is a SPINNING TOP.  He picks it up,
studying it, thinking.   He feels a draught, looks to the
window.  The CURTAIN BILLOWS.

EXT. EXTERIOR ATRIUM -- CONTINUOUS(FLASHBACK)

Cobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of the
opposite window.  HAIR BLOWING.  Feet dangling over the
dizzyingly high atrium.  She smiles.
MAL: Join me.
COBB: Mal, come back inside.
MAL: No.  I'm going to jump.  And you're
coming with me.
COBB: No, I'm not.  This is real- if you
jump, you're not going to wake up,
you're going to die.  Let's go back
inside and talk about this, please.
MAL: We've talked enough.
She KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP.
MAL (CONT'D): Come out onto the ledge or I'll jump
right now.
She means it.  Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge
opposite his wife.  He looks down at the drop.
(CONTINUED):
79A.:
CONTINUED::
MAL (CONT'D): I'm asking you to take a leap of
faith.
(CONTINUED): 80.
CONTINUED: (2):
COBB: I can't do that, Mal.  I can't leave
our children.
MAL: If I go without you, they'll take
them away, anyway.
COBB: What do you mean?
MAL: I filed a letter with our attorney.
Explaining how I'm fearful for my
safety, how you've threatened to
kill me...
Cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite, PANICKING...
MAL (CONT'D): I love you, Dom. I've freed you from
the guilt of choosing to leave them.
We're going home to our real children.
COBB: Our children are here, Mal.
Mal CLOSES HER EYES.  Cobb looks for some way to reach her...
MAL: You're waiting for a train...
COBB: NO!  MAL, NO, I CAN'T!
MAL: A train that will take you far away...
COBB:
DON'T DO THIS!:
MAL: You know where you hope this train
will take you, you can't know for
sure...
COBB:
DON'T!:
MAL: But it doesn't matter...
COBB:
NO!:
MAL: Because you'll be together-

CONTINUED: (3): Mal SLIPS FORWARD INTO SPACE.  Cobb SCREAMS after her.  Then
tries to bury his face in the wall...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE -- DAY

Cobb stares as he remembers.
COBB: Her letter to the authorities refuted
all the claims about her sanity that
she knew I'd make...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN -- DAY(FLASHBACK)

Cobb stands with the Thin Man, who has a piece of paper.
COBB (V.O.): She'd had herself declared sane by
three different psychiatrists.
Cobb hears a SHOUT- turns to the garden.  James CROUCHES,
Philippa joins him, examining the ground, FACES UNSEEN...
COBB (V.O.) (CONT'D): It was impossible for me to explain
the nature of her madness...
The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.
THIN MAN: Right now.  Or never, Cobb.
Cobb turns back to the window- about to call out- James and
Philippa RUN OFF.  Cobb turns from the window.  Looks at the
paper in his hand.  It is an AIRPLANE TICKET.
COBB (V.O.): So I ran. And I've been running ever
since, trying to buy my way back to
my family...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE -- DAY

Cobb looks across at Ariadne.
ARIADNE: Psychiatrists judged her sane?
COBB: She was sane.  She was just lost in
the labyrinth.
ARIADNE: Then why should you blame yourself?
COBB: Because we were a family.
(MORE):
(CONTINUED):
81A-81B.:
CONTINUED::
COBB (CONT'D): And we had a life I would do anything
to get back to now.  But that reality
wasn't enough for me, then.
ARIADNE: It might have been your idea to push
the limits, Cobb.  But you're not
responsible for the idea that
destroyed her.  The idea that her
world wasn't real... that was her
own idea from her own mind.
Cobb says nothing.
ARIADNE (CONT'D): Your guilt defines her.  Powers her.
If we're going to succeed in this,
you're going to have to forgive
yourself, and you're going to have
to confront her.  But you don't have
to do it alone.
(CONTINUED): 82.
CONTINUED: (2):
COBB: You don't have to do this for me-
ARIADNE: I'm doing it for the others.  They
don't know the risk they've taken
coming in here with you.
Cobb looks at the rooftop opposite, sees a SNIPER take up a
position.  Cobb shakes his head, frustrated.
COBB: We can't stay here.  Arthur?!

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Browning puts his hand on Fischer's shoulder.
BROWNING: These people are going to kill us if
we don't give them the combination.
FISCHER: They won't, they'll try to ransom us-
BROWNING: I heard them-  they're going to lock
us in and run the van into the river.
Fischer looks at the doors- the locks have been sealed...
FISCHER: What is in the safe?
BROWNING: Something for you.  Maurice always
said it was his most precious gift...
a will.
FISCHER: Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
BROWNING: It's an alternate.  It supersedes
the other only if you want it to.
FISCHER: What does it say?
(CONTINUED): 83.
CONTINUED::
BROWNING: It splits all the component businesses
of Fischer Morrow into individual
companies, transferring ownership to
the boards of those companies...
FISCHER: Leaving me nothing?
BROWNING: A basic living.  Nothing more.  The
entire empire would cease to exist.
FISCHER: Destroy my own inheritance?  Why
would he suggest such a thing?
BROWNING: I don't know, Robert.
Cobb OPENS the door.  Arthur is behind him.
COBB: Come to your senses?
FISCHER: Let us go.  I don't know the
combination.  Not consciously.
Cobb considers this.  Opens his phone.  Pulls out his gun.
COBB: Let's try instinctively.  I have
someone standing in your father's
office ready to tap in a combination.
He holds the phone to Fischer's mouth.
COBB (CONT'D): First six numbers that come into
your head.  Right now.
FISCHER: I have no idea-
Cobb SWINGS the gun onto Browning...
COBB:
RIGHT NOW!:
FISCHER: Five, two, eight... four nine one.
Cobb lowers his weapon.  Listens to the phone.  Shakes his
head.  Shuts the phone.
(CONTINUED): 84.

COBB: You'll have to do better.  Bag 'em.
Arthur puts SACKS over their heads.
146A:

INT. WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Arthur drag Fischer and Browning to the van-
FISCHER: We're worth much more to you alive...
Arthur places Fischer on the back seat- uses a DROPPER to
drop LIQUID onto Fischer's mask- his head SLUMPS FORWARD.
"Browning" yanks the sack from his head- it is now EAMES.
EAMES: (excited)
His relationship with his father's
much worse than we thought.
ARTHUR: That helps us?
Arthur pulls a SNIPER RIFLE from a case by the van.
COBB: The stronger the issues, the more
powerful the catharsis.
Cobb motions for Yusuf to follow him upstairs.
ARTHUR: But how do you reconcile them if
they're that estranged?
EAMES: I'm working on that.
Arthur lines up a shot through the window-
ARTHUR: Well, work fast- Fischer's projections
are closing in quick, we need to
break out of here before we're totally
boxed in...
Arthur SHOOTS two snipers.  Cobb and Yusuf gently load Saito
into the van.  He groans.  Ariadne straps him in, checks his
bandages.  Arthur can't get the last sniper- he's too hidden
behind a wall-
EAMES: Shouldn't be afraid to dream a little
bigger, Arthur-
Eames lines up a shot with a grenade launcher.  Fires- the
sniper EXPLODES into the air- Arthur looks at Eames.

EAMES (CONT'D): Shall we?
They climb into the van-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS -- CONTINUOUS

The Van pulls out onto the rain-drenched streets.  Arthur
opens the mechanism case and hands out tubes-
COBB: Shifting Fischer's antipathy from
his father onto Browning should work.
EAMES: We need the imagery, the words...
ARIADNE: So you destroy his one positive
relationship?
(CONTINUED): 85.
CONTINUED::
COBB: No.  We repair his relationship with
his father and expose his godfather's
true nature.
EAMES: Hell, we should be charging Fischer
as much as Saito.
ARTHUR: What about his security?  It's going
to get worse as we go deeper.
COBB: We bring in Mr.Charles.
ARTHUR: No.
EAMES: Who's Mr.Charles?
ARTHUR: A bad idea.
COBB: Arthur, the second we approach Fischer
in that hotel, they're gonna mow us
down- we run with Mr.Charles like on
the Stein job.
EAMES: So you've done it before?
ARTHUR: Sure.  But it didn't work.  The
subject realized he was dreaming and
his subconscious tore us to pieces.
Eames takes this in.
EAMES: You learned a lot, though.  Right?
COBB: (to Eames)
I'll need a decoy.
EAMES: No problem.  How about a pretty young
lady I've used before?
COBB: Fine-
Cobb looks back: a second S.U.V. pulls out, tailing them.

85A.:
CONTINUED: (2):
COBB (CONT'D): (to Yusuf)
I know you've got to stay ahead of
them, but drive with kid gloves,
okay?  The world down there is going
to be very unstable-
ARTHUR: And don't make the jump too soon-
that kick is our only way back, we
have to be ready to catch it-
YUSUF: I'll use the music to let you know
when it's coming- but the rest is up
to you.
Arthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat.
YUSUF (CONT'D): Everyone ready?
Nods all round.
YUSUF (CONT'D): Sweet dreams-
Yusuf hits a button, and we-

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR -- SUNSET

Fischer nurses a drink.  Staring at the ice cracking.
BLONDE (O.S.): Am I boring you?

CONTINUED:: Fischer looks up.  A beautiful BLONDE is next to him.
BLONDE (CONT'D): I was telling you my story.  I guess
it wasn't to your liking.
FISCHER: I have a lot on my mind.
Fischer looks around the bar.  There are several STERN-LOOKING
CHARACTERS paying him too much attention.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

Arthur and Ariadne sit at a table across the lobby.  They
spot Cobb moving across the lobby towards Fischer.
ARTHUR: And there goes Mr.Charles...
ARIADNE: Who or what, exactly, is Mr.Charles?
ARTHUR: It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer
against his own subconscious.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb approaches the bar, watched closely by Fischer's Sub-
security.
COBB: Mr.Fischer!  Good to see you again.
Rod Green, marketing.
(to Blonde)
And you must be...
BLONDE: Leaving.
She presses against Fischer as she slides off her stool and
deposits a cocktail napkin in front of him.
BLONDE (CONT'D): In case you get bored.
Cobb watches her walk away.  The Sub-security FOLLOWS her.
COBB: I think you just got blown off...
unless her phone number really does
have only six digits.
Fischer glances at the napkin: "528-491".
87.

INT. LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

Arthur watches the Sub-security follow the Blonde.
ARIADNE: And why don't you approve?
ARTHUR: Because it involves telling the mark
that he's dreaming.  Which involves
attracting a lot of attention to us.
ARIADNE: Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
ARTHUR: You must've noticed by now how much
time Cobb spends doing things he
says never to do.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb turns to Fischer.
COBB: Strange way to make friends.
(off look)
Lifting your wallet, I mean.
Fischer pats his pocket.  Empty.  He looks to the lobby where
he sees the Sub-security trailing the Blonde.
FISCHER: Goddamn it.  The wallet alone's worth-
COBB: Five hundred bucks.  I know.  Don't
worry, my guys are on it.
FISCHER: Who did you say you were?
Fischer looks at him, curious.  Cobb plows on, confident-
COBB: I said I was Rod Green from Marketing-
but I'm not.  My name is Mr.Charles.
I might seem familiar to you.  I'm
in charge of your security here.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

The Blonde hurries up to Saito, emerging from the elevator-
BLONDE: Mr.Saito, can I have a minute?
She pushes him back into the elevator, closing the door as
the Sub-security approaches...

INT. ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS

The Blonde fondles Saito's lapels, getting close.
SAITO: I'm sorry, but...
Saito glances over her shoulder to see, in the tunnel of
infinite reflections created by the elevator's opposing
mirrors, three reflections in, THE BLONDE IS EAMES.  He winks.
SAITO (CONT'D): (pushing him away)
Very amusing, Mr.Eames.
EAMES: You look a bit perkier.
A SHUDDER ripples through the elevator.
SAITO: Turbulence on the plane?
EAMES: Feels closer.  That's Yusuf's driving.
And we-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS -- DAY

Yusuf FIGHTS the wheel as the van CUTS DOWN AN ALLEY, BUMPING

IN FURIOUS PURSUIT.  Yusuf looks in the rear view mirror,
FRUSTRATED.  He checks his WATCH, then checks the back: the
SLEEPERS SHAKE with the impact and we-
CUT TO::

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR -- NIGHT

As a TREMOR echoes through the bar Fischer looks at Cobb
trying to place him.
FISCHER: Security?  You work for the hotel?
COBB: No.  My specialty is subconscious
security.
FISCHER: You're talking about dreams.  You're
talking about extraction.
COBB: Exactly.

(CONTINUED):
88A.:
CONTINUED::
COBB (CONT'D): My job is to protect you...
Behind Fischer a WAITER puts down a tray- tipping a champagne
glass over- SMASH- Cobb NOTICES.  Pauses, looks across the
bar- HIS TWO CHILDREN ARE CROUCHED, BACKS TOWARDS US...
Cobb looks around the bar, the patrons start to STARE at
Cobb, suspicious- Cobb shifts back to Fischer-
COBB (CONT'D): My job is to protect you from any
attempt to access your mind through
your dreams.
Cobb regains his patter- the patrons lose interest...

INT. ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS

Eames pulls out Fischer's wallet, moves to hand it to Saito
then PAUSES, opens it, leafs past the cash to find...  The
SNAPSHOT: young Robert holding his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his
father blowing on it.  The elevator doors open and Eames
steps off.  HANDS Saito the wallet.
EAMES: Get off at a different floor and
keep moving.
(CONTINUED): 89.
CONTINUED::
EAMES (CONT'D): Dump the wallet then meet me in the
lobby.  The security will try to
track it down.  We need to buy Cobb
a little more time.
The doors close.  Saito puts the wallet in his pocket.  He
COUGHS- a deep, nasty cough.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks over Fischer's shoulder to see a SUITED MAN
watching him.  Another MAN is walking in from the lobby.
COBB: You're not safe here.
Cobb steps away from the bar.  Fischer does not move.
COBB (CONT'D): Trust me.  They're coming for you.
Fischer sizes him up, A CLAP OF THUNDER echoes, and we-
CUT TO::

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS -- DAY

GUNSHOTS BLAST out the rear and side windows of the van- a
Security Man is leaning out of the lead S.U.V. with a SHOTGUN-
WIND AND RAIN RIP THROUGH THE VAN- in the back, ARTHUR'S
SLEEPING FACE IS WHIPPED BY THE SPRAY, AND WE-
CUT TO:: 90.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR -- SUNSET

Fischer looks out the windows at sudden, HURRICANE-LIKE RAIN-
COBB: Strange weather, huh?
A TREMOR runs through the bar- Cobb looks around-
COBB (CONT'D): You feel that?

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

Ariadne and Arthur watch the GUSTS OF WIND RATTLE the windows.
Arthur sees HOTEL GUESTS staring out at the weather, PUZZLED.
Several of them TURN TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT ARTHUR.
ARIADNE: What's happening?
ARTHUR: Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
to the strangeness of the dream.
That's making his subconscious look
for the dreamer.  For me.
And we-
CUT TO::

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS -- DAY

At the end of the alley- Yusuf THROWS the van into a HARD
RIGHT TURN- we move into EXTREME SLOW-MOTION...  THE SLEEPERS
IN THE BACK ARE DRAWN TO ONE SIDE OF THE VAN BY THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE..., and we-
CUT TO::

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR -- CONTINUOUS

The liquid in Fischer's drink RISES UP AGAINST ONE SIDE OF
THE GLASS- Fischer notices, confused.
COBB: Very odd- the weather, the gravity...
Fischer looks around the bar- it's as if THE ENTIRE ROOM IS
SET AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE- glasses SLIDING off tables...
COBB (CONT'D): But I can explain all this.  You've
actually been trained for this.
(Fischer nods)
Think of the strangeness of the
weather, the shifts in gravity.
(MORE):
(CONTINUED):
90A.:
CONTINUED::
COBB (CONT'D): None of this is real...
(beat)
We're in a dream.
Fischer looks at the room around them.  Back to Cobb.  All
through the bar, patrons turn to look at Cobb IN UNISON.
(CONTINUED): 91.
CONTINUED: (2):
COBB (CONT'D): The simplest test of what I'm saying
is for you to try and remember
anything about the way you arrived
in this hotel... okay?
Fischer stares at Cobb, trying to process this.  All around
them people STARE at Cobb.  Several get up as if to approach.
COBB (CONT'D): Breathe.  Remember the training.
Accept the fact that we're in a dream.
That's why I'm here protecting you.
As Fischer considers this we-
CUT TO:-:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS -- DAY

Yusuf STRAIGHTENS UP the van, RACING down the street, swerving
through traffic and we-
CUT TO::

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR -- EVENING

The building gradually EASES BACK INTO ALIGNMENT-
FISCHER: So you... you're not real?
The bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again.
COBB: No.  I'm a projection of your
subconscious.  I was put in place to
protect you in the event that
extractors pulled you into a dream.
I believe that's what has happened.
Fischer takes this in.  Then looks at the security men
approaching across the crooked floor, he nods at Cobb-

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- EVENING

Cobb escorts Fischer across the lobby.  As he does so he
walks past the two CHILDREN, backs to us- Cobb ignores them-
The two Sub-security fall in behind.  Cobb hurries Fischer
up the stairs- then PUSHES him into-

INT. LOBBY BATHROOM, HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

Fischer stumbles in- turns to Cobb, angry-
FISCHER: Hey-
(CONTINUED): 92.
CONTINUED:: Cobb reaches into his jacket- the First Man BURSTS in- Cobb
KICKS him to the ground- DRAWS his gun as the SECOND MAN
comes through the door, moving towards Fischer-
BLAM!  Cobb BLASTS the Second Man in the back- TURNS and
SHOOTS the First Man.
FISCHER (CONT'D): Jesus Christ!  What are you doing?!
Cobb turns to Fischer, calm.  Convincing.
COBB: Look at the gun in his hand.
Fischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol.  Cobb
opens the First Man's jacket to show Fischer his holster and
sidearm.
COBB (CONT'D): These men were sent to abduct you.
Cobb pulls out the gun and HANDS it to Fischer.
COBB (CONT'D): If I'm going to help you I need you
to be calm.
Fischer remembers something.
FISCHER: If this is a dream, I have to kill
myself and wake up-
Fischer raises the gun towards his head-
COBB: I wouldn't do that- they've probably
got you sedated- if you pull that
trigger you might not wake up, you
might drop into a lower dream state.
Mr.Fischer, you know all this, you
just have to remember it...
Fischer lowers the gun.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

Saito walks down the corridor, followed by a security man.
Saito DUCKS around the corner, moves to a GARBAGE CHUTE and
(CONTINUED): 93.
CONTINUED:: DROPS Fischer's WALLET into it.  He SLIPS into the stairwell
as the security man comes abreast of the chute and pauses.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

Arthur leads Ariadne to a particular room: 491.

INT. ROOM 491 -- CONTINUOUS

Arthur leads Ariadne in.  He opens the closet, opens the
room safe, pulls out FOUR BRICKS OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE.
ARTHUR: So, if everything's correct, this
room should be directly below 528.

INT. LOBBY BATHROOM, HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks reassuringly at Fischer.
COBB: What do you remember from before
this dream?
FISCHER: (thinking)
Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter.
(looks up)
Christ- we've been kidnapped.
COBB: Where were they holding you?
FISCHER: They had us... in the back of a van...
COBB: Your body's bouncing around in the
back of a van right now- that explains
the gravity shifts.
FISCHER: It was... to do with a safe... Christ,
why's it so hard to remember?
COBB: It's like trying to remember a dream
after you've woken up.  It takes
years of practice to do it easily.
So, you and Browning have been pulled
into this dream so they can steal
something from your mind.  What?
FISCHER: They wanted a combination to a safe...
they demanded the first numbers to
pop into my head.
(CONTINUED): 94.
CONTINUED::
COBB: That's them extracting a locator.
FISCHER: A locator?
COBB: A number from your own subconscious.
It can be used any number of ways...
(thinking)
This is a hotel.  Room numbers.
What was the number you gave them?
FISCHER: 5,2... something... it was a long
number.  528... 528, 4 something.
COBB: (opens phone)
Well, we know where to start.
(into phone)
Fifth floor.

INT. ROOM 491 -- CONTINUOUS

Arthur hangs up the phone.  He is standing on a chair,
attaching the explosives to the ceiling.
ARIADNE: Do you use a timer?
ARTHUR: No, I have to judge it myself.  Once
you're all asleep up in room 528, I
wait till Yusuf starts his kick...
ARIADNE: How will you know?
ARTHUR: His music warns me it's coming, then
the van hitting the barrier of the
bridge should be unmistakable-that's
when I blow the floor out from
underneath us and we get a nice
synchronized kick.  Too soon, and we
won't get pulled out, too late and I
won't be able to drop us.
ARIADNE: Why not?
ARTHUR: The van will be in free fall.  I
can't drop us with no gravity.
Arthur finishes setting the charges.
95.

INT. LOBBY, HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

Saito moves through the lobby.  Browning is coming in the
other direction.  Saito assumes him to be Eames.
SAITO: I see you've changed.
BROWNING: I'm sorry?
Eames comes up behind Browning, catching Saito's eye.
SAITO: I'm... I mistook you for a friend.
BROWNING: Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.
Browning moves off.  Saito approaches Eames.
EAMES: That's Fischer's projection of
Browning.  We'll keep an eye on how
he behaves-
SAITO: Why?
EAMES: How he acts will tell us if Fischer's
starting to suspect his motives the
way we want him to.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Cobb leads Fischer around a corner.  Arthur and Ariadne are
waiting in the corridor.
COBB: They work for me.
Fischer starts looking at room numbers.  Stops at 528.  Cobb
draws his gun, steps back from the door and KICKS it open-

INT. ROOM 528 -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb JUMPS into the room, gun up.  The room is empty.  Arthur
and Ariadne search the room.  Saito and Eames arrive.  Eames
shuts the door.  Arthur FINDS something-
ARTHUR: Mr.Charles!
Arthur holds up a MECHANISM CASE.  Cobb shows it to Fischer.
COBB: You know what this is?
(CONTINUED):
95A.:
CONTINUED:: Fischer's eyes roam over the dials and plungers.
(CONTINUED): 96.
CONTINUED: (2):
FISCHER: I think so.  But I don't understand.
COBB: They were going to put you under.
FISCHER: I'm already under.
COBB: Under again.
FISCHER: A dream within a dream?
ARTHUR: Shhhh!
Arthur is at the door.  Someone is there.  A key goes into
the lock- the door starts to open- Arthur REACHES OVER and
GRABS the person entering, THROWS THEM TO THE FLOOR- puts
his gun in their face.  IT IS BROWNING.
Fischer stares, disbelieving, at his godfather.
FISCHER: Uncle Peter.  What's going on?
Cobb pulls the key from Browning's hand: ROOM 528
COBB: You said you were kidnapped together?
FISCHER: Not exactly, they already had him.
They'd been torturing him...
COBB: You saw them torture him?
Fischer shakes his head.  Looks at Browning.  Thinking.
FISCHER: The kidnappers are working for you.
BROWNING: No, Robert-
FISCHER: You're trying to get that safe open.
To get the alternate will.
Browning looks up at Fischer.
BROWNING: Fischer Morrow's been my entire life.
I can't let you destroy it.
(CONTINUED): 97.
CONTINUED: (3):
FISCHER: I'm not going to throw away my
inheritance.  Why would I?
BROWNING: I couldn't take the chance of you
rising to your father's final taunt.
FISCHER: What taunt?
BROWNING: That will.  I'm sorry, Robert, but
it's his final insult.  A challenge
to build something for yourself.
He's telling you that you aren't
worthy of his achievements.
Fischer takes this in.  Devastated.
FISCHER: That he was "disappointed"?
BROWNING: I'm so sorry.  But he was wrong.
You'll make his company even greater
than he ever could.
COBB: Your godfather's lying, Robert.
Fischer turns to Cobb.
FISCHER: How do you know?
COBB: It's what I do.  He's hiding
something.
Cobb looks at Browning.
COBB (CONT'D): Let's find out what.
Cobb nods at Arthur who starts unpacking the mechanism.
Browning watches.  Silent.
COBB (CONT'D): Let's do to him what he was going to
do to you.
Cobb rolls up his sleeve.  Nods at Fischer to do the same.
COBB (CONT'D): We'll penetrate his subconscious and
find out what he doesn't want you to
know.
(CONTINUED): 98.
CONTINUED: (4): Fischer looks Cobb in the eye.  Decides- rolls up his sleeve,
offering his bare arm.  The team run tubes to each other-
Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps.
ARTHUR: He's out.
ARIADNE: Wait, Cobb- I'm lost.  Whose
subconscious are we going into?
COBB: Fischer's.  I told him it was
Browning's so he'd come with us as
part of our team.
ARTHUR: (impressed)
He's going to help us break into his
own subconscious.
COBB: That's the idea.  He'll think that
his security is Browning's and fight
them to learn the truth about his
father.
Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism.  The team goes out one
by one.  Cobb is last.
COBB (CONT'D): Fischer's subconscious is going to
run you down hard.
ARTHUR: I'll lead them on a merry chase.
COBB: Be back in time for the kick.
ARTHUR: I'm on it.
Cobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains,
BILLOWING like those in Mal's suite- a GLIMPSE of someone
(Mal?) as the screen goes WHITE, and we are-

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS -- DAY

CLOSE ON Cobb's face, staring.  Fixed.
ARIADNE (O.S.): Cobb?  Cobb?
Ariadne is beside him.  They stand on a cliff, dressed in
white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like WWII
commandos.  Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their
objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY  a mile below.
(CONTINUED):
98A.:
CONTINUED::
ARIADNE (CONT'D): What's down there?
COBB: Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer
to learn.
ARIADNE: I meant what's down there for you?
Cobb turns to her.  Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING
down from the hill above.  Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer's
earshot.
COBB: You're the dreamer, I need you to
draw the security away from the
complex.
(CONTINUED): 99.
CONTINUED:  (): 
EAMES: Then who guides Fischer in?  You?
COBB: If I know the route... we could be
compromised.
Eames looks at Cobb, uneasy.  Ariadne comes over.
ARIADNE: I designed the place.
COBB: No.  You're with me.
SAITO (O.S.): I could do it.
They turn to Saito.  Saito shrugs at Eames.  Eames smiles.
COBB: Eames, brief Saito on the route into
the complex.  What we're looking for
is going to be in the most heavily

Cobb moves to Fischer.  Saito COUGHS.  SPITS.  Eames sees
BLOOD on the snow.  Looks at Saito.
COBB (CONT'D): Mr.Fischer, you're going in with
Saito.
FISCHER: You're not coming in?

COBB: You have to do this on your own. You

Cobb taps Fischer's radio mike.
COBB (CONT'D): Keep this live at all times.  I'll
be listening in, covering you.
(holds up the sniper
rifle)
The windows on the upper floors are
big enough that I can cover you from
that south tower.
Cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle.
100.
CONTINUED: (3): Cobb turns to Fischer.  Smiles.
COBB: The truth.
And we-

Arthur checks the mechanism.  He hears LOW BOOMS like thunder.
He checks his watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS FORWARD.  With a
last look at the sleepers he heads out into the corridor...
177A:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS -- DAY

A GUNSHOT slams into the van as Yusuf DRIVES- he glances
back to see a MOTORCYCLE pulling up behind him, the REAR
PASSENGER FIRING A SHOTGUN- the bike pulls alongside Yusuf's
window as the passenger RELOADS- Yusuf YANKS the wheel TOWARDS
the bike, bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can
GRAB it, spin the wheel back- PULLING the passenger from the
back of the bike... Yusuf turns a corner, heading into a
disused MARKET-

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

Arthur walks towards the elevator.  It OPENS- a SECURITY MAN
emerges, heading right for him.  Arthur takes a TURNING,
speeding up.  The BOOMS are louder, and we-
CUT TO::

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS -- DAY

The bike crosses behind the van, catching up again as the
driver pulls a handgun and starts BLASTING.  Up ahead, an
S.U.V. sits in a side road, lining up to head off the van-
the SECURITY MAN driving the S.U.V. guns it, as the the bike
creeps up on the other side of the van- Yusuf HITS THE BRAKES,
forcing the bike out into the path of the S.U.V.- BAM- the
bike SPINS off the front corner of the S.U.V. tossing the
rider like a rag doll-
Heading out of the market, the van races onto a FREEWAY ON
RAMP, approaching the BRIDGE.  An S.U.V. SMASHES into the
van's side, FORCING it up against a CRASH BARRIER... the van
starts to SLOWLY TILT OVER THE BARRIER as the S.U.V. PUSHES-

Arthur and the security man DROP to the floor, Arthur on
top.  Arthur gets up- heads to the stairwell.
182A:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREET NEAR BRIDGE -- DAY

The van SETTLES with a thump.  Yusuf BREATHES hard.  Then
SMILES as he realizes he is in one piece.  A RINGING BELL up
ahead makes him look up to the bridge, where the barriers
are starting to come down.  Yusuf checks his watch-
YUSUF: Bugger.
Yusuf hits the gas, heading for the bridge.  An S.U.V. lines
up behind him, trying to catch up before the van crosses the
barrier onto the bridge-
The van JUST MAKES IT- the S.U.V. behind RIPS its rear axle
off, SCRAPING to a halt on the rising section.  The Security
man inside starts FIRING on the van...

Eames watches them close in, then launches himself down the
mountain, STREAKING across the icy slope, and we-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RISING BRIDGE -- DAY

Yusuf PULLS FORWARD, looking over his shoulder to line up a
BACKWARDS RUN at the edge.  He DUCKS as a vicious FIRE from
the S.U.V. HAMMERS the vehicle.  He looks at his watch.  The
SECOND HAND TICKING SLOWLY...
YUSUF: Sod it.  I hope you're ready.
He grabs an MP3 player and reaches into the back to place
HEADPHONES on sleeping Arthur's head.  As he does so he
notices Saito's bandage BLEEDING THROUGH.  Yusuf hits PLAY-
Edith Piaf's "Non, Je ne Regrette Rien" starts up and we-
CUT TO::

INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

Arthur STOPS, hearing something- MASSIVE LOW-END MUSICAL
TONES- he looks up PANICKED-

Eames is hidden at the base of some trees, whispering as a

EAMES: I noticed it twenty minutes ago- at

Cobb is listening intently.  The "wind" changes pitch.
COBB: No, it's music.  Dammit.

COBB: We move fast.  Saito, did you copy?

EXT. MOUNTAINS, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

Saito and Fischer CLIMB down a CLIFF FACE above the complex-
SAITO: We're going as fast as we can.

Ariadne looks at Cobb, concerned.
ARIADNE: How long do we have?
COBB: Yusuf's about ten seconds from the
jump, which gives Arthur about three
minutes, which gives us about-
ARIADNE: Sixty minutes.
COBB: The route you gave them, can they do
it in under an hour?
ARIADNE: I don't think so.  They've still got
to climb down to the middle terrace.
COBB: They need a new route- a direct route.
ARIADNE: The building's designed as a
labyrinth.
(CONTINUED): 103.

COBB: There must be access routes that cut
through the maze.

Eames cannot answer- he SLALOMS through the forest, sub-
security in hot pursuit, bullets smashing into the trunks...

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb turns to Ariadne.
COBB: Did Eames add any features?
ARIADNE: Yes.
COBB: What did he add?
Ariadne looks at Cobb.
ARIADNE: I shouldn't tell you.  If Mal-
COBB: There's no time- what did he add?
ARIADNE: Utility closets, trap doors...
COBB: What about service features?  Did he
add any large pipes or-
ARIADNE: Ducts.  He added an air duct system-
it doesn't follow the maze- they can
use it to go straight from the outer
walls to the upper tower.
COBB: Explain it to them.

Arthur RUNS UP the stairs, gun in hand- rounds a corner and-
IMPOSSIBLY- arrives behind the security man- who looks at
him, CONFUSED, then looks down to realize he is now at the

ARTHUR: Paradox.
Arthur PUSHES him over the edge- he falls- Arthur races up

In ZERO GRAVITY, Arthur pulls himself to the door of 491,

ARTHUR: How the hell do I drop you?
He PULLS the charges from the ceiling.  Hurrying.  And we-

Saito and Fischer hurry through the duct system.  Saito is
falling behind, coughing up blood.

EXT. UPPER TERRACE, HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

unconscious.  He beckons to Ariadne, covering her as she
runs towards him.  They enter the base of the south tower.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

A guard is manning the tower.  Cobb and Ariadne enter- Cobb
SHOOTS the guard and moves to the window.
ARIADNE: (she points)
That's the ante chamber outside the
strong room.
Cobb looks at the large windows of the ante chamber.
COBB: What about the strong room?  Doesn't
it have any windows?
ARIADNE: Wouldn't be very strong if it did.
(off look)
Look, if you wanted to design it
yourself-
(CONTINUED): 107.
CONTINUED::
COBB: It's fine.  Better hope that we like
what Fischer finds in there.
Cobb sets up his sniper rifle.  Through the scope he can see
three guards on the balcony outside the chamber.  Three more
inside.  Cobb casually picks them off with his rifle.  Ariadne
watches through binoculars, appalled.
ARIADNE: These projections, they're parts of
his subconscious?
COBB: Yeah.
ARIADNE: Are you destroying those parts of
his mind?
COBB: No, of course not, they're just
projections.
EAMES (over radio)
Cobb?  Something's wrong.

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- DAY

Saito and Fischer approach the grate covering the exit to
the ante room.  Saito SLUMPS to the floor of the duct, pulls
out his radio.  Fischer looks at him- he is PALE, SHIVERING.
Fischer takes the radio, WHISPERS into it.
FISCHER (over radio)
We're here.  Are we clear to proceed?

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb SCANS the ante room through the scope- it looks clear.
COBB (into radio)
You're clear, but hurry- there's an
army headed your way...
Ariadne watches the patrols approaching the complex...

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

The SQUELCH from the radio is too loud- Fischer GRABS it and
turns the volume to zero as he starts to remove the grate...

EXT. BASE OF THE HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

Eames is setting MINES along the LOWEST WALL of the structure.
He moves carefully- there is a SHEER DROP below the wall...

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb SPOTS something through his scope.  Something above the
main windows, glimpsed through the side of the skylight.
COBB: Shit.  There's someone else in there.
Cobb prepares to fire.  Ariadne GRABS the radio-
ARIADNE: (into radio)
Fischer, stop!   It's a trap!-
109.

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

Fischer does not see the flashing light on his radio as he

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb TENSES to fire...
COBB: Come on... a little lower... a little-
COBB FREEZES- IT IS MAL IN HIS SIGHTS.  Ariadne puts up her
binoculars.  Spots Mal.  Fischer is climbing out of the
vent...
ARIADNE: Cobb, that's not really her-
Cobb turns to her-
COBB: How can you know that?

INT. ANTE CHAMBER -- CONTINUOUS

Fischer moves into the ante chamber, cautious...
FISCHER (into radio)
I'm in.
Fischer turns up the volume-
ARIADNE (over radio)
Fischer, look out-!
Mal DROPS gracefully to the floor behind him-
MAL: Hello.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks at Ariadne-
ARIADNE: Cobb, she's just a projection.
Fischer... he's real.
Cobb thinks.  Nods, TURNS back to the scope- too late- MAL
SHOOTS FISCHER- Cobb reflexively pulls the trigger- Mal GOES
DOWN- Cobb steps back from the scope, STUNNED.
ARIADNE (CONT'D): Eames?  Get to the ante room now!
They run for the door, and we-

In EXTREME SLOW-MOTION, the van CREEPS DOWNWARDS, still high

He hits the button- the doors open- he pushes them in- GRABS
the charges- climbs through the hatch in the ceiling and we-

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- DAY

Eames steps over Saito, who looks up at him with DYING eyes-

INT. ANTE CHAMBER, HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- DAY

Eames jumps out of the vent to find Cobb and Ariadne standing
over the bodies of Fischer and Mal.
EAMES: What happened?
COBB: I wouldn't shoot her.
Eames looks down at Mal.  Eames pokes Fischer with his boot.
EAMES: That's it, then.  We failed.
(CONTINUED):
110A.:
CONTINUED::
COBB (CONT'D): Even if you could revive his body-
his mind's trapped down there.  It's
over.
Eames listens for a pulse.  Looks up at Cobb.
EAMES: So that's it, then?  We failed.
COBB: I'm sorry.
EAMES: It's you who doesn't get back to
your family.
Eames looks down at Fischer.  Then over to the double doors.
EAMES (CONT'D): I wanted to know what was going to
happen in there.  I think we had
this one.
ARIADNE: There's still a way- we follow Fischer
down-
They look at her.
EAMES: We're almost out of time-
ARIADNE: Down there they'll be enough time.
We'll find him- soon as you hear
Arthur's music start you use the
defibrillator to revive him- we give
him his own early kick from below.
Get him in there-
(points to doors)
Then, as the music ends you blow the
hospital and we all ride the kick
back up through the layers.
Eames looks at her, then to Cobb.
EAMES: Okay, Saito can hold them off while
I plant the rest of the charges.
COBB: Saito's not going to last, Eames.
ARIADNE: We have to try!
(CONTINUED):
110B-111.:
CONTINUED: (2):
EAMES: Go for it, but I'm taking the kick
whether you're back or not...
Eames pulls the mechanism from his pack.  Offers it to
Ariadne.  Cobb watches.  Silent.  Ariadne pulls out the tubes-
ARIADNE: Can I trust you to do what's needed?
Mal's down there-
(CONTINUED): 112.
CONTINUED: (2):
COBB: I've been there before- I can find
her.  Fischer will be with her.
ARIADNE: How do you know?
COBB: She wants me to come after him.  She
wants me back down there with her.
Cobb rolls his sleeve up.  Ariadne rolls up her own sleeve.
Eames hoists the DETONATOR.
EAMES: How will you know when I'm going to
blow the kick?
Cobb points at a machine on the wall.
COBB: Use the defibrillator as a kick.
Revive Fischer first.  If he can get
in there-
(indicates doors)
We can still finish this job.
Eames NODS.  Cobb and Ariadne lie down.  Eames hits the button-
WATER.  BUBBLES.  DROWNING.  And we are-

EXT. COAST(LIMBO) -- DAY

Ariadne lies in the SURF, STARING up at a CLOUDLESS SKY.  A
tremendous BOOM prompts her to look around her-
URBAN BUILDINGS PILED right down to the water.  The buildings
are DECAYING, falling into the ocean like a GLACIER calving.
Cobb WADES towards her through the shallow water.  Ariadne
looks up at the crumbling city around them.
ARIADNE: This is your world?
COBB: It was.  And this is where she'll
be.
And we-
CUT TO:: 113.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT -- DAY

Arthur floats on top of the elevator, planting small charges
on the EMERGENCY BRAKES and CABLE.  He sets them, GRABS the
other explosives, then PUSHES AWAY, shooting up the shaft.
As he hits the DETONATOR, BLASTING the braking and safety
systems of the elevator, we move into SLOW MOTION, the
fireballs FLAMING OUT in graceful licks and we-
DISSOLVE TO::

INT. ANTE CHAMBER -- DAY

Eames RACES around, full speed- getting the defibrillator
paddles- laying them by Fischer's body- he runs into the
duct- pulls Saito up to a sitting position and hands him a
handgun.
EAMES: Come on, Saito.  I need you to cover
Fischer while I plant the charges.
Saito nods weakly, tries to hold the gun.  Eames moves to
the window- pulls his machine gun off- checks its load.
Ready.  He watches the security patrols climb up the outer
walls... Eames lays down a HAIL of covering fire- then heads
outside-
236A:

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

Eames races along the upper terrace dodging fire- BULLETS
SHATTER a window behind him and we move into SLOW MOTION,
the glass CASCADING GENTLY and we-
DISSOLVE TO::

EXT. COAST (LIMBO) -- DAY

Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed.  They
move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings.  The
streets are eerily DESERTED.  As they move further in, the
buildings become NEWER, different.  Ariadne marvels at the
extraordinary collection of buildings- every architectural
style imaginable in waves of FAILED UTOPIAS.
ARIADNE: You built all this?
COBB: We both did.
ARIADNE: It's incredible.
COBB: We built for years.  Then, when that
got stale, we started in on the
memories.
(CONTINUED):
113A.:
CONTINUED:: A child's SHOUT echoes through the deserted canyons, prompting
Cobb to look down a side street: a LITTLE BLONDE BOY crouched,
his back to us.  A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy, and, as
Cobb turns down the street, they run off.
(CONTINUED): 114.
CONTINUED: (2): Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar SQUARE lined with an
eclectic mix of buildings, from APARTMENT BLOCKS to HOUSES.
COBB (CONT'D): This is our neighborhood.
ARIADNE: (confused)
From what city?
COBB: No.  Our neighborhood.
(pointing)
That was our first apartment... then
we moved to that building... we got
that small house when Mal became
pregnant.
ARIADNE: You reconstructed them all from
memory?
COBB: We had time.
Cobb pauses in front of a French country house.  Staring.
ARIADNE: What's that?
COBB: The house Mal grew up in.
ARIADNE: Will she be in there?
COBB: No.  Come on-
Cobb leads Ariadne to the entrance of a glass skyscraper.

INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY (LIMBO) -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb leads Ariadne across the gleaming lobby to the elevators.
COBB: We both wanted a house, but we both
loved skyscrapers.  In the real world
we had to choose.  Not here.

INT. SKYSCRAPER ELEVATOR (LIMBO) -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out his handgun, and a ziplock bag full of bullets.
ARIADNE: How do we send Fischer back?
(CONTINUED):
114A.:
CONTINUED::
COBB: We need some kind of kick.
(CONTINUED): 115.
CONTINUED: (2):
ARIADNE: What?
COBB: I'll improvise.
Cobb COCKS his weapon, and the ELEVATOR STOPS.  The doors
open.  Ariadne moves to exit, Cobb stops her.
COBB (CONT'D): There's something you have to
understand about me.  About inception.
You see, an idea is like a virus...
Cobb leads her out of the lift...

INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) -- CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Ariadne step off the lift and into the incongruous
interior of a craftsman house.  They cautiously move down
the corridor towards the back of the house...
COBB: Resilient...
(turns to Ariadne)
Highly contagious, and an idea can
grow.  The smallest seed of an idea
can grow to define or destroy your
world...
Cobb is staring into the kitchen.  Mal is sitting at the
table, back to them, staring out at the porch- the TOWERS of
limbo stretching off behind it.
MAL: The smallest idea, such as...  "your
world is not real."
Cobb hands Ariadne his gun and moves towards Mal
MAL (CONT'D): A simple little thought that changes
everything...
Ariadne watches as Cobb sits down beside Mal.  And we-
CUT TO:: 116.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT -- NIGHT

Arthur FLIES back down the shaft to the top of the elevator,
SQUEEZES past the car to the bottom and starts to set the
MAIN CHARGES ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR, and we-
CUT TO::

INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) -- DAY

Cobb touches Mal's arm- she TURNS, angry.  It is only now
that we see that she holds a CARVING KNIFE.  Mal looks at
Ariadne.
MAL: So certain of your world.  Of what's
real.  Do you think he is-
(points at Cobb)
Or do you think he's as lost as I
was?
COBB: I know what's real.
MAL: What are the distinguishing
characteristics of a dream?  Mutable
laws of physics?  Tell that to the
quantum physicists.  Reappearance of
the dead?  What about heaven and
hell?  Persecution of the dreamer,
the creator, the messiah?  They
crucified Christ didn't they?
COBB: I know what's real.
MAL: No creeping doubts?  Not feeling
persecuted, Dom?  Chased around the
globe by anonymous corporations and
police forces?  The way the
projections persecute the dreamer?
Mal puts her hand on his face.  Pitying.
MAL (CONT'D): Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in
one reality anymore.  So choose.
Choose your reality like I did.
Choose to be here.  Choose me.
COBB: (rising anger)
I have chosen, Mal.  Our children.
I have to get back to them.  Because
you left them.  You left us.
(CONTINUED):
116A.:
CONTINUED::
MAL: You're wrong, Dom. You're
confused...our children are here-
(CONTINUED):
116B-117.:
CONTINUED: (2): A child's SHOUT draws Cobb- James CROUCHES on the porch,
back to us.  Philippa joins him, also turned away.  Cobb
watches, moved.  Mal leans in close.
MAL (CONT'D): (whispers)
And you'd like to see their faces
again, wouldn't you, Dom?
COBB: Our real children our waiting for me
up above.
And we-
CUT TO:: 118.

INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

Arthur scrambles to arrange the sleepers on the floor of the
car- as his hand comes away from Saito, he sees BLOOD on it.
(CONTINUED): 119.
CONTINUED:: He looks at Saito's belly- the blood is coming through his
shirt.  Arthur sticks headphones on sleeping Eames, and we-
CUT TO::

EXT. HOSPITAL FORTRESS -- DAY

Eames throws a GRENADE, blowing up the security forces trying
to ascend the terraces.  He DUCKS to the ground to avoid
HEAVY FIRE- starts unpacking the charges and setting them
along the base of the terraces-

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX -- CONTINUOUS

Saito looks up as he hears a security guard climbing through
the duct... he raises his gun, TREMBLING with weakness...
And we-
CUT TO::

INT. KITCHEN, PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) -- DAY

Mal laughs at Cobb.
MAL: (laughs)
Up above?  Listen to yourself.  You
judged me for believing the very
same thing.
Mal points at the children-
MAL (CONT'D): These are our children.  Watch.
(turns to the kids)
Hey, James!  Philippa?!
The children START TO TURN to us- BUT COBB CLOSES HIS EYES.
COBB: They're not real, Mal.  Our real
children are waiting for us-
The children run off.  Cobb opens his eyes.
MAL: You keep telling yourself that but
you don't believe it-
COBB: I know it-
MAL: And what if you're wrong?  What if
I'm what's real?
Cobb is silent.
(CONTINUED):
119A.:
CONTINUED::
MAL (CONT'D): You keep telling yourself what you
know... but what do you believe?
What do you feel?
Cobb looks at Mal.  Struggling.
COBB: Guilt.  I feel guilt.  And however
confused I might get.  However lost
I might seem... it's always there.
Telling me something.  Reminding me
of the truth.
MAL: What truth?
COBB: That you were wrong to doubt our
world.  That the idea that drove you
to question your reality was a lie...
(CONTINUED):
119B.:
CONTINUED: (2):
MAL: How could you know it was a lie?
COBB: Because it was my lie.
MAL: (realizing)
Because you planted the idea in my
mind.
COBB: Because I performed inception on my
own wife then reaped the bitter
rewards...
ARIADNE: Why?
COBB: We'd become lost in here.  Living in
world of infinite possibilities.  A
world where we were Gods.  I realized
we needed to escape, but she'd locked
away her knowledge of the unreality
of this world...
INSERT CUT: Mal opens the Doll's house.  Takes the spinning
top, lies it down in the safe.  LOCKS IT AWAY.
COBB (CONT'D): I couldn't make Mal understand that
we needed to break free.  To die.
So I started to search our world...
Cobb turns to Mal, but keeps talking to Ariadne...
INSERT CUT: Cobb WANDERS the streets of Limbo...
COBB (CONT'D): Searching for the right place in her
mind...
INSERT CUT: Cobb stops outside the VICTORIAN HOUSE, MAL'S
CHILDHOOD HOME, looking up at it.  He heads inside...
COBB (CONT'D): And when I found that place, that
secret place where she had shut away
her knowledge years before, I broke
it open...
INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around Mal's childhood bedroom.  Comes
to the doll's house...
(CONTINUED):
119C.:
CONTINUED: (3):
COBB (CONT'D): I broke into the deepest recess of
her mind, to give her the simplest
little idea.
INSERT CUT: Cobb throws open the safe doors.  Sitting on the
shelf of the safe is a spinning top.  On its side.
(CONTINUED):
119D.:
CONTINUED: (4):
COBB (CONT'D): A truth that she had once known, but
had chosen to forget...
INSERT CUT: Cobb picks up the totem.  He SPINS it in the
safe.  IT SPINS AND SPINS WITHOUT END.  Cobb CLOSES THE DOOR
of the safe...
COBB (CONT'D): That her world was not real.
INSERT CUT: COBB AND MAL ARRIVE AT TRAIN TRACKS CUTTING
THROUGH WASTELAND:
COBB (V.O.) (CONT'D): That death was necessary escape.
They lie on the tracks looking into each other's eyes.  Mal
is crying.  Cobb takes her hand, reassuring.  He starts to
speak-
COBB (dialogue) (CONT'D)
You're waiting for a train.  A train
that will take you far away.  You
know where you hope this train will
take you, but you can't know for
sure.  Yet it doesn't matter...
Mal looks at him across the railroad tracks.  Replies-
MAL: Because you'll be together.
The train comes, OBLITERATING the lovers.
Back in the present- Cobb looks into Mal's eyes.  She is
crying.
COBB: I never thought that the idea I'd
planted would grow in her mind like
a cancer.  That even after we woke...
INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around the HOTEL SUITE, confused.  He
moves to the CURTAINS.... Mal is on the ledge opposite.
COBB (CONT'D): You'd continue to believe that your
world was not real...
Crying, Mal nods-
MAL: That death was the only escape?
INSERT CUT: Mal PLUNGES to her death.
(CONTINUED):
119E.:

MAL (CONT'D): You killed me.
Cobb looks at Mal.  Whispers-
(CONTINUED):
119F.:
CONTINUED: (6):
COBB: I was trying to save you- I'm sorry.
Mal comes in close to Cobb.  Looks him over.
MAL: You infected my mind.  You betrayed
me.  But you can make amends.  You
can still keep your promise.  We can
still be together... right here.  In
our world.  The world we built
together.

ARIADNE: Cobb, what are you saying?

Ariadne looks up as a LARGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS across
the sky... she looks down to see Fischer, BOUND AND BLOODY,
lying below the rail.
ARIADNE: He's here.  And it's time.  But you
have to come with us.
Another massive lightning strike flickers across the sky-
ARIADNE (CONT'D): Cobb, I'm not going to let you lose
yourself in here!  You have to get
back to your children!
COBB: Send Fischer, I have to stay-
ARIADNE: You can't stay here to be with her-
Cobb turns from Mal.  Looks at Ariadne.
COBB: I'm not.  Saito is dead by now.
That means he's here.  I have to
stay here and find him.
Ariadne removes Fischer's gag- pulls him up, onto the rail.
Cobb looks back at Mal.
COBB (CONT'D): I can't stay here to be with her
because she's not real.
(CONTINUED): 121.
CONTINUED:: Mal looks at Cobb, furious.
MAL: Not real?  I'm the only thing you do
believe in anymore.  Here- doesn't
this feel real, Dom?
She STABS him in the chest- Cobb WHEEZES- GASPING, looking
at Mal-
COBB: I wish you were.  But I couldn't
make you real.  I'm not capable of
imagining you in all your complexity
and... perfection.  As you really
were.  You're the best I can do.
And you're not real.
Mal pulls the knife and moves to STRIKE again-
ARIADNE: No!
A SHOT rings out, Mal GRABS her shoulder- Cobb turns to
Ariadne, who is pointing Cobb's gun.
COBB: What're you doing?
ARIADNE: Improvising.
She KICKS Fischer off the roof- AIMS again at Mal-
Fischer DROPS as the sky LIGHTS UP WITH ELECTRICITY- Fischer

He is reaching for the SAFE next to his bed.  His fingers
fumble at the keypad, he can't open it.  His son pushes
5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad.  Opens it.  Inside the safe is
the WILL.  And beside it is a HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, clearly
made by a child.  By Fischer.  He takes it out, MARVELLING
at it.  He turns to his father, but his father is dead.
Eames, watching from the door, HITS THE DETONATOR-

ARIADNE: You're coming!
COBB: No, I'm not.  I'm staying here to

promised me.
COBB: I know.  But we can't.  And I'm sorry.
MAL: You remember when you asked me to
marry you?  You said you dreamt that
we'd grow old together.

Browning and DRAG him out-

Fischer breaks the surface with Browning, who COUGHS and

Ariadne, Arthur and Yusuf wait calmly underwater.  They are
sharing TWO REGULATORS pulled from beneath the front seat.
Arthur he turns to Saito.  There is blood in the water around
Saito's belly- his eyes are LIFELESS-  Arthur feels for a
pulse... turns to Cobb, whose eyes are lifeless... Ariadne
GRABS Arthur's elbow, pulling him away...

EXT. RIVERBANK -- MOMENTS LATER

Fischer turns Browning/Eames over.  They lie there, exhausted.
BROWNING: I'm sorry, Robert.
Fischer stares at the rain on the water.
FISCHER: The will means that Dad wanted me to
be my own man, not live for him.

And I'm going to, Uncle Peter.
Browning nods.  Wipes the rain from his face.  In the puddle

Cobb WOLFS his food.  The Elderly Japanese Man (Saito, ninety

SAITO: So... have you come to kill me?
Cobb does not look up.
SAITO (CONT'D): I've been waiting for someone to
come for me...
COBB: Someone from your half-remembered
dream..?

young men together.  And I am an old
man...
COBB: Filled with regret?
Saito REMEMBERS, nods...

SAITO: Waiting to die alone, yes.
Cobb is STARING at something on the table.
COBB: I came back for you...  I came to
remind you of what you once knew...
Cobb gestures at the table.  Saito follows his gaze down to
the polished surface of the table...
COBB (CONT'D): That this world is not real.
The top is still SPINNING PERFECTLY, AS IF IT WILL NEVER
TOPPLE.  Saito looks at the top.  Then back to Cobb.
SAITO: You came to convince me to honour
our arrangement?
COBB: Yes.  And to take a leap of faith.
As Saito-san listens to Cobb he looks at the GUN on the table

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D): We'll be landing in Los Angeles in
about twenty minutes.  Do you need

Cobb nods.  Takes a landing card.  Looks around the cabin.
Saito is WATCHING him.  Serious.  Haunted.  Holding Cobb's
gaze, SAITO PICKS UP THE PHONE AND DIALS.  Cobb nods thanks...

INT. ARRIVALS, LAX -- LATER

Cobb steps forward to the IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL.  Hands him
his passport.  Nervous.  The Official takes a beat, looks
Cobb up and down, then WHUMP!- the passport is stamped.  As
Cobb takes it back he spots Ariadne at the next counter.
She nods at him.  He nods back.  Then moves off...
As Cobb passes through baggage claim he exchanges subtle
greetings with Eames and Yusuf.

who glances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know
him, then moves on...
As Cobb emerges into the crowded Arrivals Hall, he spots
Professor Miles, waving at him...

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE -- DAY

Cobb enters with Miles.  Drops his bags.  Moves to the table,
looking out at the overgrown garden.  He reaches into his
pocket, takes out his pewter spinning top, lowers it to the
table and SPINS IT- a CHILD'S SHOUT makes him look up-
Through the window, James and Philippa have run into view,
playing, THEIR FACES TURNED AWAY... Cobb STARES at the back
of his children's heads... Miles moves to the window and
KNOCKS on the glass-
James and Philippa TURN- see their Dad.  He steps to the
window, watching their BRIGHT FACES SHINING as they run

Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING.

BLAM!  Bullets hit dirt and bricks near him- the street ahead
is barricaded, manned by FRENCH TROOPS-
TOMMY:
ANGLAIS!  ANGLAIS!: The French stop firing and wave him through.
He SCRAMBLES over their sandbag barricade, taking in their
dirty, frightened faces as he passes...
A FRENCH SOLDIER grabs him-
FRENCH SOLDIER: Allez, Anglais.
Tommy's mouth opens at the man's BITTERNESS.
FRENCH SOLDIER (contempt) (CONT'D)
Bon voyage.
He SHOVES Tommy down the street behind their protection.

EXT. BEACH AT MALO LES BAINS - CONTINUOUS

The LONGEST, WIDEST BEACH he's ever seen, sunlight DAZZLING
off the water-
Endless dark FENCES snaking across the sand and out into the
water-
Tommy SQUINTS- not fences- lines of MEN-
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MEN...
Tommy looks around, clutching his stomach.  He CLAMBERS over
a dune, FEVERISHLY undoing his belt, dropping trousers and
SQUATTING before he realizes-
He's not alone-
Another soldier, British army shirt undone, sweating with
the labour of BURYING A BODY.  This is GIBSON.
The other man notices Tommy, but barely pauses.  Tommy
finishes, pulls up his trousers and moves towards him.
(CONTINUED): 3.
CONTINUED:: Tommy helps scoop sand over the body.
Tommy notices the corpse's STOCKINGED FEET, then watches
Gibson stoop to TIE HIS BOOTS...
Gibson looks up at him.  Tommy shrugs, gestures for Gibson's
water can.  Gibson hands it over and Tommy takes a SWIG,
carefully CATCHING drops in his hand, then LICKING them off
his palm.
Tommy leaves Gibson buttoning his shirt and heads back onto
the beach.
There are DESTROYERS out on the water, too far to reach.
Tommy wanders down to join one of the long, snaking lines
which extends into the sea, soldiers up to their CHESTS in
water, WAITING PATIENTLY FOR SHIPS WHICH DO NOT MOVE.
The man at the back turns to Tommy, unwelcoming.  Points at
his own insignia.
MAN: Grenadiers, Mate.
Tommy moves off.  Looks around at other impossibly long lines.
At the unattainable ships.  Futile.
A line of STRETCHER BEARERS comes past, carrying wounded men
along the beach towards the harbour...
Looking where they're headed, Tommy sees a LONG, NARROW
BREAKWATER extending out into the sea, packed with soldiers.
A HOSPITAL SHIP at the end of it.
This breakwater extends a kilometer into the sea.  It is
called THE MOLE.
Super title:

Tommy becomes aware of the sound of DISTANT AIRCRAFT.
Soldiers peer up into the sky...

The lines of men INSTANTLY VANISH- soldiers SCATTERING back
to the dunes, BURROWING into the sand... the first BOMBS
lift sand into the air-

them, protecting them as the area is HAMMERED...
The first STUKA pulls out of its dive, revealing TWO MORE
STUKAS DIVING- there are NINE MORE about to follow...
Tommy sees a soldier lying ON HIS BACK, RIFLE AIMED AT THE
SKY, FIRING DEFIANTLY, DESPERATELY at the attacking plane...
the ground around him LIFTS into the air with the second
wave of bombs.
Tommy buries his face in the sand as the bombs BLAST AND
BLAST AND BLAST-: The explosions stop.  Tommy lifts his head.  BOOM- ANOTHER
WAVE OF BOMBS EXPLODES IN SERIES UP THE BEACH.  Then, finally,
quiet.  Tommy rises...
The stretcher bearers, back on their feet, lift their burdens
(four bearers per stretcher, one at each corner).
Several stretchers are left behind on the sand.
Soldiers on the beach watch in despair as one of the
DESTROYERS is slipping below the water, smoke billowing.

EXT. MOONSTONE, ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY

Mr.Dawson is on the bow, peering ahead.  The distant smoke
is closer, small shapes in the sky move above distant ships,
accompanied by thunderous booms...
Much nearer: a shape.  A WRECK.  Upside down.
Mr.Dawson moves quickly down the yacht to the well and takes
the helm, throttling back.  He gestures for Peter to head to
the bow.
The Moonstone approaches the wreck.  BODIES surround the
overturned hull.
Crouched on the hull- a SOLDIER.
Mr.Dawson REVERSES the screw, slowing to a crawl.  Peter
stares out at the SHIVERING SOLDIER.
PETER: Can you swim it?
The Shivering Soldier STARES back at Peter.  Peter looks
back at Mr.Dawson-
PETER (CONT'D): Can you get closer?
Mr.Dawson looks down the side of the boat, considers.
MR.DAWSON: Can't risk it!
Mr.Dawson turns to George.
MR.DAWSON (CONT'D): Take Peter a line.
George grabs a coiled rope and heads up to the bow.  Peter
takes the rope from George-
PETER: I'll throw you a line!
(CONTINUED): 18.
CONTINUED:: The shivering soldier looks up at him, blank.  Peter tosses
the line.  It hits the water several feet in front of the
soldier who STARES at it.
Peter gathers the line, then TOSSES it again-
The shivering soldier SPRINGS for it, GRABBING it and HANGING
ON as Peter and George reel him in, pulling him around to
the stern ladder.
He is too exhausted to make it up the ladder, so they grab
his shirt, pulling him into the well.
George grabs a blanket and puts it around the soldier's
shoulders.
Mr.Dawson glances at the Soldier, then reverses from the
wreck the way he came in, and steers wide around the visible
portion of the wreck.
Once the water ahead is open, Mr.Dawson speeds up, heading
again for the dark smoke of Dunkirk.

From high above we see how trapped and exposed this line of
men stretching a kilometer into the sea really is.

The onslaught is ENDLESS, TERRIBLE and INESCAPABLE...
BOOM!  A direct hit to the Hospital Ship-
The Stukas have gone.
Screams and shouts- people start JUMPING OVER THE SIDE of
the HOSPITAL SHIP onto the mole...
VOICES: She's going down!  SHE'S GOING UNDER!
Commander Bolton shouts at the men manning the lines-
COMMANDER BOLTON:
CUT HER LOOSE!: The crew are jumping off the side, the burning ship is SINKING-
SUB-LIEUTENANT: What about the wounded?
COMMANDER BOLTON: Cut her loose, and push her off!  We
can't let her sink at the mole!
The men cast her off and PUSH her off-
Crew members and orderlies LEAP from the deck into the water-
The bow of the BLAZING, SINKING ship drifts away from the
mole...
Tommy and Gibson pull soldiers up onto the beams of the
mole...
As the bow comes around, the stern SCRAPES along the wooden
pilings, SPLINTERING them in its path-
A FLAILING SOLDIER is in its path, trying to swim free-
The STEEL HULK is about to CRUSH HIM-
Tommy GRABS him by the shoulders and YANKS with all his might,
pulling him clear just as the hull GRINDS against the wood-
Tommy looks down on the breathless, wet soldier.  The wet
Soldier focuses on Tommy.
THIS IS ALEX.  He nods thanks.  Tommy nods back.

George reaches out for the Shivering Soldier's arm- who SMACKS
it away-
MR.DAWSON: Leave him, George.
George looks up at the Commander.

them... then helps them push into the group...
They follow the wet soldiers up onto the mole, where Bolton's
men shepherd them onto a LAUNCH.

Tommy and Gibson make themselves inconspicuous amongst the
Highlanders, eyes down.

It approaches a DESTROYER, its sheer iron side TOWERING above
the launch, as it BOBS up and down alongside.
CARGO NETS are dropped over the side, and the men start to
step up onto the rail of the BOBBING ship, waiting for the
RHYTHMIC movement towards the iron wall- GRABBING at the
rope mesh, STRUGGLING to pull themselves up.
Tommy steps up to the railing, next to an EXHAUSTED soldier
who can barely lift himself up- Tommy grabs his shoulder to
steady him on the rail as the launch BOUNCES off the iron
wall of the destroyer-
They both grab at the net, Tommy climbing up-
The exhausted soldier has not got his feet into the netting,
he slips lower...
The gap between the launch and the destroyer shrinks to

The soldier's legs are CRUSHED between the two oblivious
craft-
He SCREAMS- hands PULL him up as the craft separate...

Mr.Dawson looks back towards Britain.  Then forward to France.
Thinking.  Shakes his head.
MR.DAWSON: Come too far.
BOOM!  Explosions nearby-
The Shivering Soldier moves into a foetal position.
Mr.Dawson and Peter look ahead to where PLUMES of water rise,

throttling up-
MR.DAWSON: Heinkel.
Mr.Dawson points at a MINESWEEPER heading towards them...

Highlander1 is confused.
Tommy GRABS the Seaman, PULLING him down into the hold.
Highlander1 holds his gun on him-

SEAMAN: Dutch!  Dutch!  Merchant navy.  Here

someone who ought to get off...
Alex turns to Tommy and Gibson.  Points at Gibson.
ALEX (CONT'D): This one.  He's a German spy.
TOMMY: Don't be daft.
Alex stares Gibson down...
ALEX: He's a bloody jerry.  You might not've
noticed that he hasn't said a word,

Englishman lying out on that sand.
Or did you at least have the decency
to bury him?
'Gibson' just stares.
TOMMY: He did.  I helped him- I thought it
was his mate.
ALEX: Maybe he killed him-
TOMMY: He didn't kill him-
ALEX: How do we know?!
TOMMY: How hard is it to find a dead
Englishman on Dunkirk beach, for
God's sake?!  He didn't kill anyone-
he was looking for a way off the

The Seaman assesses the leaks...

Alex NUDGES Gibson with the rifle-
ALEX: Go on- up you go-
TOMMY: As soon as he pokes his head out
they'll slaughter him-
ALEX: Better him than me-
TOMMY: It's not fair-
ALEX: Survival's not fair.
HIGHLANDER1: No, it's shit.  It's fear and greed.
Fate squeezed through the bowels of
men.  Shit.
TOMMY: He saved our lives.
HIGHLANDER2: And he's about to do it again- go on-
Alex starts shoving Gibson up the stairs-
TOMMY: No!  Just stop!
Alex turns to Tommy- looks him in the eye-

be volunteering next-

We're regimental brothers, mate.

EXT. MOONSTONE, WATER OUTSIDE DUNKIRK HARBOUR - CONTINUOUS

Peter steps out of the cabin, REELING.  Meets his dad's
questioning glance with unmistakable shock-
SHIVERING SOLDIER (O.S.): The lad...
Peter turns.  The Shivering Soldier is looking up at him
with terrified eyes, blanket TIGHT around his shoulders.
SHIVERING SOLDIER (CONT'D): Will he be okay?
Peter looks at the Shivering Soldier.  Sees the WHITE KNUCKLES
clasping the edge of the rough blanket.  Peter NODS.
The Shivering Soldier turns, staring out at the destroyer.
Peter catches Mr.Dawson looking at him.  Approving.

over the Keith... the BOMBS DROP-
PLUMES OF WATER SHOOT UPWARDS ALL AROUND THE SHIP- Tommy
DIVES under the water for protection- the EXPLOSIONS ARE
DEAFENING- HE HOLDS HIS EARS WITH HIS HANDS-
Tommy BREAKS the surface- the barrage is over- the Keith is
still afloat- Tommy swims for it-
Getting closer, Tommy realizes he's swimming in OIL, the
black sludge covering his head and arms- he looks back- the
blue trawler is gently slipping beneath the water...
Tommy makes for the Keith, even as he sees men JUMPING into
the water from her decks... LIFEBOATS being lowered...
Tommy SPOTS another craft- a YACHT HEADING TOWARDS THEM-
Tommy PULLS for the yacht as hard as he can...

MANY MORE still in the water...  the Keith LISTS, men jump
off the far side, away from the oil slick, where small ships
are gathering to pick them up...

The Heinkel FALLS FLAMING TOWARDS THE OIL SLICK...
Peter has hold of one last oil-covered survivor, who hangs
on for dear life as the boat DRAGS HIM THROUGH THE OILY WATER-
The men left in the water shout with despair as the Moonstone
motors away-
The FLAMING HEINKEL HITS THE WATER- EXPLODES-
THE SURFACE OF THE WATER CATCHES FIRE- SPREADING ACROSS THE
WATER- MEN DUCK UNDERWATER TO ESCAPE THE FLAMES-
UNDERWATER: HIGHLANDER1 pushes down under, LOOKING UP AT THE
FIRE... the SURFACE IS AFLAME AS FAR AS HE CAN SEE...
Peter HOLDS on to the oil-covered soldier-
Who is now being washed with cleaner water as they COME out
of the slick-
As the oil comes off his face we see that IT IS TOMMY...
Collins watches, appalled, as the men in the water are
engulfed by RELENTLESS FLAMES... the Keith is going down-
survivors on the far side are picked up by the various SMALL
SHIPS...: Under the water, HIGHLANDER1'S AIR RUNS OUT- the FLAMES RAGE
ABOVE...:

beaches...
He looks down at-
The thousands of men on the beach,
The small ships ferrying out to the larger vessels,
The narrow mole with its endless rope of men...
Farrier is awestruck...
He hears his engine start to SPUTTER...
It dies and the prop STOPS...

Commander Bolton watches with satisfaction as a PADDLE STEAMER
ties up... he calls up to a STEWARDESS(59)-

STEWARDESS: Out of Dartmouth!
Bolton shakes his head in joyous disbelief.  He watches men
load into a SMALL OPEN SAILBOAT crewed by two YOUNG MEN-
COMMANDER BOLTON: From Deal?
(they nod)
Mind the current at the mouth, boys.
Bolton spots Spitfire 1- it SOARS overhead.  He waves-
MALE VOICE (O.S.): Where've you been all my life?!
Commander Bolton SIGHS at this... then notices.  No engine
noise.
(CONTINUED): 64.

straightens up.  Mr.Dawson SPOTS THE 109, CLOSING...

before he fires he'll have to lower
his nose, I'll give you the signal...
Peter reaches over to the side of the wheel, ready to throw
it- the 109 is practically upon them...

The GUNS ON THE 109 LIGHT UP, STRAFING THE WATER TO STARBOARD-
The 109 FLASHES OVER... Collins watches it recede.
COLLINS: He's off.
MR.DAWSON: Bigger fish to fry.
Collins looks at Mr.Dawson.  Curious.
COLLINS: How'd you know all that, anyway?
Mr.Dawson steps onto the deck.
MR.DAWSON: My son's one of you lot.  I knew
he'd see us through.
Mr.Dawson moves forward.  Collins steps up beside Peter.
COLLINS: You're RAF?

INT. COCKPIT, SPITFIRE 1 - DAY

beach to ditch...
In the strangely SILENT plane, he passes over the troops,
lines up on the vast stretch of sand beyond Malo les Bains...
CUT TO::

EXT. HARBOUR AT WEYMOUTH - NIGHT

Soldier after soldier climbs out of the yacht.  The CORPORAL
handing out travel chits marvels at the absurd amount...
CORPORAL: How many you got in there?
The Shivering Soldier is taken ashore, wrapped in blankets.
Tommy and Alex stick together as they are handed hot cups of
tea and shepherded out of the harbour in long lines.

Where the hell were you!

EXT. WEYMOUTH RAIL YARD - NIGHT

Tommy and Alex, exhausted, downcast, are herded across the
tracks towards a train.  Before getting on they are handed a
BLANKET and cup of tea by an ELDERLY MAN, who looks at their
hands not their faces as he hands the rough blanket over-
ELDERLY MAN: ...well done, lads...  well done,
lads...
ALEX: All we did is survive.
ELDERLY MAN: That's enough.  Well, done, lads,
well done, lads...

No response.  He looks over- Tommy is already asleep.

EXT. THE MOLE - EVENING

The Mole is EMPTY but for bodies.
A PRIVATE opens his eyes.  He sits up, alone on the deserted
Mole, his comrades gone, mistaken for dead...
COMMANDER BOLTON (O.S.): Come on, then, private...
The Private looks down at the water to see Commander Bolton
standing in a launch full of ARMY OFFICERS.
(CONTINUED): 69.
CONTINUED::
COMMANDER BOLTON (CONT'D): I know we're officers, but it's us
or the enemy, so now's not the time
to be particular...
The Private scrambles down into the launch, where Colonel
Winnant stands talking to Commander Bolton.
They look out at the vast deserted beach, littered with
corpses and abandoned equipment...
COLONEL WINNANT: (to Commander Bolton)
Churchill got his 30 thousand.
COMMANDER BOLTON: And then some.  Almost three hundred
thousand.  So far.
Commander Bolton steps back up onto the mole.
COLONEL WINNANT: So far?
COMMANDER BOLTON: I'm staying.
(off look)
For the French.
The Launch pulls away from Commander Bolton on the mole.

Alex thrusts the paper at Tommy.
ALEX (CONT'D): I can't bear it.  You read it.

The platform is packed with CHEERING AND WAVING CIVILIANS...
Women with SANDWICHES and DRINKS rush up to the windows...
